# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-06

### Removed

- Removed inactive Auto-Compact v2 reducer implementations and stale reducer type names with no active planner path/caller (`state-compress`, `scored-tool`, `intelligent-prune`, plus already-removed `snip`/`ast-skeleton` compatibility names). The runtime contract is now exactly `dedupe -> stale-tool -> summarize -> drop`.
- Removed legacy SSH abstraction helpers/tests (`LocalOs`, `RemoteOs`, `SshOs`, `remotePath`) that were no longer used by the live `clew ssh` session path (`createSSHSession` / `SSHSessionManager`).
- Removed superseded agent-tree durability/refinement surfaces (`durableMessageQueue`, `retainedArtifacts`, `selfRefinement`) now replaced by the active `agentRuntime/tree`, artifacts, and refinement implementations.
- Removed dead Agent config provider/permission picker implementations and the stale `/agent-config all` help text; provider and permission remain available through their explicit subcommands.
- Removed the unreachable legacy `_compactViaReactive` manual-compaction path and its `REACTIVE_COMPACT` loader, plus several unused runtime-only type/constant remnants.
- Deleted dead memory compatibility surface with zero callers: `src/memory/store.ts` (`getSource`/`upsertSource`/`deleteSource`/`insertChunks`/`getAllSources`/`searchChunksFTS`/`scanMarkdownFiles`, some of which were misleading no-ops) and `src/memory/migrateLegacy.ts` (`migrateFromSessionDB` always returned zeros); `/memory init` no longer runs the fake migration flow.
- Removed the misleading no-op `MemoryDB.db` SQLite-compat getter; collapsed the duplicated init branches and clarified filesystem naming in `MemoryDB.init`/`getMemoryDbPath` docs.
- Removed the stale `re-expose any MCP tools` TODOs in `src/entrypoints/mcp.ts`: the MCP server entrypoint exposes only built-in tools by design (no MCP tool proxying).
- Removed the Bridge v2 Remote Control feature (`/remote` command): `RemoteServer`/`RemoteBridge`/`RelayClient`/`RemoteConnector`/`tokenStore`/`relay-server`/`useRemoteBridge` and the `bun run relay` script are gone. CCR (`--remote`/teleport), SSH sessions, and remote-session history infrastructure are untouched.

### Added

- **New Clawd Poses:** Four new mascot poses — `blink` (closed eyes), `look-up` (eyes raised), `shocked` (wide-eyed), and `sleeping` (closed eyes + z) — plus two new click animations (`BLINK`, `STARTLE`) on `AnimatedClawd`, which now dozes off into the `sleeping` pose after 3 minutes of inactivity.

### Changed

- Route OpenCode Zen Responses API models, including Muse Spark Contributor Free, through `/responses` instead of the generic `/chat/completions` adapter.

- Added CI debt ratchets for runtime circular imports and `@ts-expect-error` directives. The circular detector now excludes type-only imports/exports, reducing the meaningful runtime-cycle baseline from the previous noisy 1,329 report to 337; suppression debt is locked at 1,372 and both baselines may only move downward.

### Fixed

- Fixed IDE diff lifecycle races: the hook now uses a stable callback instead of reopening a diff on every render, resets cancellation state for each effect run, closes the IDE tab on unmount, awaits cleanup on terminal paths, and no longer relies on a suppressed process-exit listener.
- Hardened permission settings edits against malformed lenient JSON: dynamic allow/deny/ask buckets are normalized to string arrays before map/filter/spread operations instead of relying on `@ts-expect-error`, preventing corrupted settings from throwing at runtime.
- Fixed `/providers key <provider> <key>` session-only mode reporting success without applying the key; session keys now take effect immediately, and `--global` / `-g` flags are stripped before key parsing so flags can never be persisted as part of a credential.
- Fixed provider picker session/global isolation: session-only provider/model/providerConfig changes no longer rewrite shared `provider.json`.
- Fixed Azure OpenAI configuration so the endpoint and API key are separate inputs/contracts; the endpoint is stored as provider metadata, while credentials use `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (with compatibility fallbacks). Removed the non-functional Google Vertex option from the generic Google picker because `GoogleProvider` did not consume its project/Vertex settings.
- Fixed stale async UI updates in `SessionPreview`, `useDynamicConfig`, and provider model loading by ignoring completions after dependency changes/unmount.
- Fixed `ToolGateway` authorizing arbitrary `eval.*` tools that had no execution implementation; unknown tools now fail closed before dispatch.
- Fixed Windows Bash snapshot fallback so a hung snapshot actually times out after the grace period instead of awaiting the same hung promise inside its timeout callback; no-snapshot execution now keeps valid shell spawn args.
- Fixed `ToolGateway` workspace escape: `startsWith(root)` allowed `<root>-evil/...` siblings; now requires a full segment boundary plus `realpath` symlink confinement (case-insensitive on win32/darwin).
- Implemented missing `src/server/parseConnectUrl.ts` (`cc://` deep links; clear error for `cc+unix://`) and removed the now-unneeded `@ts-expect-error` suppressions in `main.tsx`.
- Added the six missing built-in agents (`researcher`, `collector`, `extractor`, `synthesizer`, `reporter`, `verifier`), fixed `planner.handoff_to`, and added a builtin topology integrity test so workflows can no longer name agents that don't exist.
- Enforced `RuntimeBudget` in the agent loop: wall-clock `timeoutMs`, `maxToolCalls`/`maxLlmCalls` counters, per-agent `max_steps`, `maxChangedFiles`, patch/output byte caps, and real `timeLeftMs` in the agent context (`maxCostUsd` stays documentary until a cost-reporting adapter exists).
- Enforced agent `network` permission for shell commands (deny/guarded network patterns) and workflow `approval.required_for` (`shell.network`, `shell.destructive`, `git.commit`, `git.push`) ahead of agent permissions; `verification.required` is injected as `_or_explain` agent instructions.
- Fixed approval resume dropping the original tool input (`repo.patch` resumed as `{}`): approvals now persist the full input, with fallback for legacy entries.
- Made `RunStore` IDs race-safe (atomic `mkdir` reservation), JSONL loads tolerant of single corrupt lines, and `approvalLocks` self-cleaning.
- IDE diff approval is now fail-closed (unknown responses reject instead of auto-accept) with a 5-minute inactivity timeout falling back to terminal approval.
- Fixed localhost security checks to classify by URL hostname (`isLocalhostUrl`) instead of substring, so `localhost.attacker.example` no longer gets plain-ws/`v2`/HTTP treatment.
- Long-poll `pollRemoteSessionEvents` now refreshes OAuth tokens when needed instead of failing after expiry mid-poll.
- Marked all throwing Agent SDK function stubs as placeholders with an explicit file banner (types stay real; no new throwing stubs).
- Broke five circular-import hotspots (1337 → 1330 cycles; checker stays soft-warning): `detectFileEncoding` moved to `fileReadCache.ts`, pricing/display helpers moved to `modelOptions.ts` so `model.ts` no longer imports `modelCost.ts`, `findGitRoot` moved to `git/gitFilesystem.ts`, mock-billing override cell extracted to leaf `utils/mockBillingOverride.ts`, and the `debug → slowOperations → debug` edge replaced with a reporter hook (plus plain `JSON.stringify` in the logger to avoid slow-tracker re-entrancy).
- Implemented Teams dialog `h`/`H` hide-show: `hideTeammate`/`showTeammate` were no-ops since introduction and now drive `backend.hidePane`/`showPane` (tmux `break-pane`/`join-pane`) with `hiddenPaneIds` tracking, so the UI refresh reflects real pane state. `showPane` target is now optional (backend resolves the leader window).
- Checkpoint/goal persistence failures are no longer silent: `QueryEngine` checkpoint writes/promotions and all five `sessionGoalState` writers now `logError` on failure, and `sessionGoalState` exposes `getGoalPersistenceError()` so stale on-disk state is diagnosable instead of assumed saved.
- Hid empty and completed label-only `Thinking…` placeholders, while retaining live buffers and substantial completed previews.
- Kept ChatGPT reasoning deltas in one live thinking block so the `∴ Thinking` text streams continuously and its spinner remains active until reasoning completes.
- Prevented the status-line `ctx%` estimate from counting split assistant records from the same API response twice.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Filesystem-first Memory:** `MemoryDB` migrated from `bun:sqlite` to Markdown+YAML SoT under `.clew/memory/store/*.md` with frontmatter (`id/key/type/importance/confidence`), `timeline.jsonl`, and derived `index.json` ephemeral cache (mtime+size, atomic write, `getIndexedEntries`). Git-friendly, no DB corruption.
- **Filesystem-first Taste:** `SqliteTasteStore` → `FileTasteStore` under `.clew/taste/rules|evidence|conflicts/*.md` with same philosophy, dual-scope (project/global), `taste.db` now legacy.
- **Taste Auto-Learning:** `Signal (explicit 1.0 / behavioral 0.6 / outcome 0.2) → Evidence → Learner → Rule` with clustering (Jaccard 0.6), confidence, conflict detection, and promotion `candidate(0.45)→weak(0.65)→active(0.80)→conflicted` with 7-day windowed `aggregator` + decay. Hooks on `FileEditTool (userModified)`, `BashTool (test/build/lint)`, and `QueryEngine (explicit preference)`.
- **Taste Explainability:** `/taste why [id|#]` and `/taste learn <kind> <rule>` with `evidenceCount`, `recentCount`, `lastReinforced`, and conflict trail.
- **Prompt Cache — Full Coverage:** `shouldUseExplicitPromptCaching` now `explicit + automatic` (27 providers), deterministic tool sorting for stable prefix, `CLEW_CACHE_RETENTION` alias for `PI_CACHE_RETENTION`, and `CLEW_CACHE_RETENTION` defaults to `long` (1h) without env.
- **Cleanup Script:** `scripts/cleanup-memory-db.mjs` (`bun run cleanup:memory-db` / `:dry`) removes legacy `memory.db/chunks.db/taste.db` (+ wal/shm) for both `.clew` and `.claude` legacy paths.

### Changed

- `promptCaching: automatic` providers now send `cache_control` 4-breakpoint markers (system+tools+user+assistant) for higher hit rate; `should1hCacheTTL` defaults to `long` for Clew.
- `hierarchy.ts` now creates `store/` dir and `getMemoryDbPath()` points to filesystem store; `isMemoryHierarchyInitialized` checks directory existence.

### Fixed

- `AppStateStore` `getSettings()` → `getInitialSettings()` tsc error.
- `claude.ts` tool sort now handles `BetaMCPToolset` without `name` field.


## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-30

### Removed

- Deleted `.reference/` directory (scraped competitor docs, not used by the project).

## [0.9.7] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **PromptInput Multiline Scroll Indicators:** Dynamic top (`── ↑ N more ──`) and bottom (`── ↓ N more ──`) scroll indicators when input exceeds visible viewport; line counts capped at `1000+`; eliminated double borders and fixed `>` prompt pointer alignment.
- **Pasted Text Direct Input:** Allowed multiline text pastes up to 1,000 lines (or 100,000 characters) to be inserted directly into `PromptInput` with viewport scrolling instead of collapsing into `[Pasted text #N]` chips.
- **Plan Mode to TODO Auto-population:** Automatically extracts actionable checklist items and steps from approved plans into the TODO task queue with `PLANS TODO` section header.
- **AI Custom Output Style Generator:** Interactive custom style creator in `/output-style` allowing users to describe desired tone/format, generate via LLM, review/regenerate, and save to `~/.clew/output-styles/`.
- **Settings Screen Redesign:** Grouped `/config` settings into 4 clean ASCII categories with searchable section headers and `● true` / `○ false` indicators.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- **Shell task UI:** Animated braille spinner in `ShellProgress` for running tasks; `BackgroundTaskStatus` uses `useAnimationFrame` for shell pill spinner; `BackgroundTasksDialog` uses `useInput` for `x`/`f` shortcuts so they fire even when focus is lost; `ShellDetailDialog` adds `useInput` for `space`/`left`/`c`/`x` shortcuts.
- **Shell stdin hang fix:** `exec()` now closes `stdin` immediately after spawning so child processes don't hang waiting for EOF (`src/utils/Shell.ts`).


## [0.9.5] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- **Token efficiency:** `getTokenCountFromUsage` now takes an `includeOutput` flag (default true for billing); `tokenCountWithEstimation` passes false so ctx% and auto-compact threshold reflect **window-fill only** (input + cache tokens), not output tokens. Fixes ctx% inflating from long responses. (`src/utils/tokens.ts`)
- **Reduced memory injection:** Budgeted memory per turn dropped from 1500 → 600 tokens (`src/constants/prompts.ts`).
- **Earlier auto-compact:** `actNow` threshold lowered from 80% → 70% of usable window, so compaction triggers before the context is critically full (`src/services/compact/v2/limits.ts`).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- **Auto-compact at 80%:** `computeLimits` now `actNow = floor(limit * 0.8)` for all models (was `limit - 40k`), matching manual `/compact` at 80% ctx (`src/services/compact/v2/limits.ts`).

- **`/model` picker:** Reworked the standalone picker into a compact terminal model console with type-to-search, aligned context/Vision/Tools/Reasoning/effort columns, a current-session marker, Fast Mode status, and a focused-model price spectrum backed by the existing provider pricing table. Live model rows backfill missing capability metadata from the registry and then OpenRouter's cached model catalog, while truly unknown fields remain `?`. Reused Settings pickers keep their original layout. (`src/components/ModelPicker.tsx`)
- **Capability-aware `/model` Effort tab:** Replaced the separate effort list with the same Faster → Smarter rail used by `/effort`. The rail shows only levels supported by the focused model (`low/medium/high`, adding `xhigh`, `max`, and `ultracode` when valid), and moves the animated purple spotlight to that model's highest available level. Enter applies the choice to the current session. (`src/components/ModelPicker.tsx`, `src/commands/effort/effort.tsx`)
- **Provider-wide cache observability:** Normalized cache usage from Anthropic, OpenAI/Responses-compatible, DeepSeek, and Gemini schemas; every provider now declares its prompt-cache behavior; `/cost` reports hit/miss/unsupported/unreported status, token hit rate, reporting coverage, and estimated savings for subscription and API-key sessions. `/usage` now separates true token hit rate from large-cache-miss exposure. (`src/services/ai/usageTypes.ts`, `src/services/ai/cacheMetrics.ts`, `src/commands/cost/cost.ts`, `src/components/Settings/Usage.tsx`)

## [0.9.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **Provider→model→ctx→api hardening:** `isModelIdMatch` separator-bound fixes `gpt-4` vs `gpt-4o` substring bug in 6 files (`providerModels`, `context`, `modelCapabilities`, `prompts`, `thinking`), `4-6→4-6` canonical fix, `toolToAPISchema` cache bust, `max_output` cap for 8k free models, free `500` fast-fail.
- **Shell background:** Footer/list/detail live progress (`⠋ shell: cmd · elapsed`, tail 16KB, OSC52 copy).
- **Log/Registry fixes:** `fileHistoryEnabled` ReferenceError, semver `[0.3.7]` bracket, `logError` import.

### Changed

- **Provider feature flags:** Unify `PROACTIVE→KAIROS` (35 checks), `KAIROS_*→KAIROS` (61 checks), `MCP_*→CHICAGO_MCP` (13 checks) — 52 files, 109 checks simplified.
- **README:** Sync `ctx%`/task/mcp/shell docs, baseline `0`.
- **Large files:** `REPL.tsx 6544→6477` via `featureFlags`+`constants` split.
- **Memory:** Consolidate `extractMemories`+`autoDream → longTermMemory` (6 files, re-export old paths).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **Prompt system for task/todo:** System prompt now enforces `ALWAYS use TaskCreate/TodoWrite BEFORE 2+ steps` (`3→2` threshold, `TURNS 10/10→3/5`, remove ant gate, `REQUIRED: MUST` reminders). Fixes LLM rarely calling task tools.
- **Typecheck:** `1,581 → 0` via `Transport.ts` interface, 128 module stubs, 147 DCE suppressions, and `as any` casts for remaining mismatches.
- **Circular deps:** `ScheduleCronTool/UI` and `ScheduleFollowup/UI` break circular `Tool→UI→Tool` via `any` types (`1,341→1,337`).
- **Large files:** Split `attachments.ts` (`3.5k→2.9k` via `taskReminders.ts`) and `REPL.tsx` (`6,773→6,544` via `helpers`, `TranscriptModeFooter`, `AnimatedTerminalTitle`, `TranscriptSearchBar`).
- **Tests:** `915→959` (+44, 22 tools) — added `Bash`, `FileWrite`, `AskUser`, `Goal`, `Brief`, `Monitor`, `NotebookEdit`, `Browser`, `ComputerUse`, `ContextRestore`, etc.

### Changed

- **Auto-compact v2: disabled two low-value reducers.** `scored-tool` (an LLM fork that picks tool results to evict, falling back to `stale-tool` when the fork is unavailable) and `intelligent-prune` (a regex heuristic that drops whole messages matching `done`/`fixed` etc., untested, loss 0.92) are removed from the active `REDUCERS` ladder. The remaining order is `dedupe → state-compress → stale-tool → ast-skeleton → snip → summarize → drop`. Re-enable either when per-reducer analytics justify it.

### Fixed

- **`/memory timeline|stats|digest|digests|preview|consolidate` were permanently broken.** All six subcommands dynamically imported `services/longTermMemory/timeline.js` and `consolidate.js`, neither of which existed — every invocation failed with a caught `Cannot find module` and reported a misleading "Error loading …" message. `/memory graph`'s help text advertised `/memory timeline` regardless. Both modules are now implemented against MemoryDB, matching the contract `crossSession.ts` documents (session records are `note` memories keyed `session.<id>` whose body starts with `Session: `). The parser also tolerates historical records that were written double-prefixed as `Session: Session: …`.
- **PowerShell destructive-command warnings were missing eight patterns BashTool had**, despite a comment claiming parity: `git checkout .`, `git restore .`, `git branch -D`, `git commit --amend`, `git … --no-verify`, `DELETE FROM`, `kubectl delete`, and `terraform destroy`. On Windows these ran through PowerShellTool with no warning. Shell-agnostic patterns now live in `src/tools/shared/destructiveCommandPatterns.ts` and are consumed by both tools, so they cannot drift again. Covered by a parity test.
- **Provider config merge could be clobbered by blank saved values.** `applyProviderSwitch` spread the on-disk provider config over the registry entry wholesale, so a saved empty `baseUrl`/`apiKey` erased a real registry endpoint. Merging now ignores `undefined`/`null`/`''` from the saved config while preserving meaningful falsy values (`0`, `false`), via a new exported `mergeProviderConfig` seam.
- **Memory redaction missed most credential formats.** `src/memory/redact.ts` guarded content on its way into the on-disk memory store with only 6 patterns, while a 37-rule gitleaks-derived scanner sat unused next door. Memory redaction now runs those rules first, so AWS/GCP/Azure/DigitalOcean/HuggingFace and other provider credentials are redacted before they reach disk.

### Removed

- **~2,700 lines of unreachable code**, verified against an import graph covering static imports, `await import()`, `require()` and feature-gated loads: `src/components/agents/` (7 files, never referenced), `src/commands/bridge/` (superseded by `src/bridge/`), `src/tools/ComputerUseTool/{input,index,toolDefinition}.ts` (superseded by `utils/computerUse/platform/`), `src/server/lsp.ts` + `src/server/lsp-standalone.ts` + `src/cli/lsp.ts` (closed cycle with no entry point), `src/ink/fallbackUI.ts`, and four unused hooks plus their private `useStats` helper in `src/context/stats.tsx`.
- 42 unused imports and 43 unused local bindings across the tree.

### Changed

- **Todo task tree:** The expanded task list now renders as a compact TODO tree with Roman-numeral section headings, per-section completion counts, checkbox states, and strikethrough completed items. Tasks can opt into ordered sections with `metadata.group` and `metadata.groupOrder`; existing tasks remain compatible under the default Execution section.
- **Agent activity placement:** The live Working / Needs input / Completed agent roster now renders below the input prompt and status footer instead of below the transcript logo.
- **Deduplicated logic that had been copy-pasted between modules**: `skipTimeoutFlags` + `TIMEOUT_FLAG_VALUE_RE` (a security-relevant `timeout` wrapper parser duplicated byte-for-byte across `bashPermissions.ts` and `pathValidation.ts`) → `src/tools/BashTool/timeoutFlags.ts`; the Anthropic auth-header builder → `src/services/anthropicAuthHeaders.ts`; the shared accept/reject switch in the Bash and PowerShell permission dialogs → `handleSharedShellPermissionChoice`; `parseGoalChain` → `src/tools/GoalTool/goalChain.ts`; `findAvailableTask` → `src/utils/tasks.ts`; the pane-creation mutex → `createSequentialLock` (a factory, so the iTerm and tmux backends keep independent locks).
- **Resolved four colliding `isProcessRunning` definitions** onto the canonical one in `src/utils/genericProcessUtils.ts`. Two of the removed copies lacked its `pid <= 1` guard, so a lockfile recording pid 0 or 1 was previously treated as a live process forever.
- **Disambiguated same-named redaction and tmux helpers** that did different things: `redactSecrets` → `redactSecretFieldsInJson` (bridge debug JSON) and `redactWithScannerRules` (gitleaks rules); `isTmuxAvailable` in `tmuxSocket.ts` → `isTmuxSocketReady` (it returns cached state synchronously, unlike the two async probes); `worktree.ts` now re-exports the single async probe from `swarm/backends/detection.ts`.
- Restored the missing type modules `src/components/Spinner/types.ts` (`SpinnerMode`, `RGBColor`) and `src/components/FeedbackSurvey/utils.ts` (`FeedbackSurveyResponse`, `FeedbackSurveyType`), reconstructed from usage and verified against `tsc`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-27

- **Dead code removal**: Deleted unused exports `getAutoCompactHardThreshold` / `getBackgroundAutoCompactThreshold` (`src/services/compact/autoCompact.ts`), `getNextCheckpointThreshold` + `CHECKPOINT_THRESHOLDS` (`src/services/checkpoint/checkpointWriter.ts`), and `migrateLegacyEmbeddings` / `clearLegacyEmbeddingCache` (`src/memdir/semanticSearch.ts`); removed now-orphaned `computeBackgroundThreshold` import and `unlink` import. Deleted the matching obsolete test blocks in `compact.test.ts`. No behavior change.

- **Durable Agent Session Tree & Token Ledger (`src/services/agentTree/`)**:
  - **Agent Session Registry** (`agentSessionRegistry.ts`): Persistent hierarchical tree of every agent spawned under a root session (main, subagents via AgentTool, teammates, background tasks) with states `running | needs-input | idle | inactive`. File-backed under `~/.clew/agent-tree/<rootSessionId>/sessions.json` so the tree survives TUI close/restart and can be listed/attached on reopen.
  - **Rooted Token Ledger** (`agentTokenLedger.ts`): Every API response attributed to `(rootSessionId, agentId, parentAgentId)` and appended to `tokens.jsonl`. Wired at the single usage increment point (`addToTotalSessionCost` in `cost-tracker.ts`), so both Anthropic and provider-agnostic flows land here. Cost footer now includes `By agent:` breakdown sorted by spend.
  - **Durable Message Queue** (`durableMessageQueue.ts`): Per-agent JSONL inbox with `pending → delivered` acks. Messages written while TUI is closed remain and are drained on next attach.
  - **RetainedArtifactStore** (`retainedArtifacts.ts`): General-purpose companion to compact v2's EvictionStore — producers can park large content outside the context window and recall by handle (`[retained: label — ~N tokens — recall with restoreArtifact("ev_xxx")]`). Own namespace (`<session>-artifacts/`) so it never collides with reducer evictions.
  - **Controlled Self-Refinement** (`selfRefinement.ts`): Proposals with diff/provenance/verifier/rollback stored under `.clew/refinements/{pending,applied}/`. `approveAndApply()` runs verifier (must exit 0), snapshots original content for instant rollback, archives record. Nothing touches disk until explicit approval.

- **AgentTool Robustness, Model Routing & Multi-Turn Accounting Fixes**:
  - **Tool Payload Compatibility**: Agent calls may omit the display-only `description`; Clew now derives a short label from `prompt` instead of rejecting every parallel spawn. `TaskCreate({ subject, action: "complete" })` payloads emitted by models are also accepted and complete the matching existing task rather than entering a validation-error retry loop.
  - **Accurate Failure Classification**: `finalizeAgentTool` now detects `isApiErrorMessage: true` and API errors in transcript messages, properly setting status to `failed` rather than masking failed tasks as `completed`. Widened `outputSchema` to support `failed`, `blocked`, `canceled`, and `error` statuses.
  - **Multi-Turn Token Accounting**: Fixed token count calculation to accumulate `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, and `cache_creation_input_tokens` across all turns in the agent's sidechain instead of only reading the final turn.
  - **Authoritative UI Token Stats**: Upgraded `UI.tsx` to read authoritative result `totalTokens` and fall back to non-zero streaming progress usage, eliminating `0 tokens` display bug.
  - **Provider/Model Compatibility Guard**: Added pre-flight check in `getAgentModel` to ensure `subagentModel` is compatible with the active provider or fall back to `inherit`, preventing `invalid_request` errors when a subagent model is sent to an incompatible provider.
- **Prime-Style Layered State (L1/L2/L3) Architecture & Runtime**:
  - **Rooted Resource Accounting & Circuit Breakers (`src/services/accounting/`)**: Hierarchical token and cost tracking across recursive subagent trees with `/cost tree` reporting. Enforces circuit breakers: `maxDepth` (3), `maxChildrenPerAgent` (5), and subtree token/cost budget caps to prevent runaway token spend.
  - **RetainedArtifactStore (`src/services/artifacts/`)**: TypeScript artifact retention engine replacing Python REPL state. Retains raw test logs, search results, and diffs in L2 storage outside L1 context using compact handles (`@artifact:test_1_x7k2`) with automatic TTL and reachability GC.
  - **Durable Agent Session Tree & Mailbox (`src/agentRuntime/tree/`)**: Unified hierarchical registry for `AgentTool`, swarm workers, and background daemons with persistent mailbox queue and robust lifecycle state tracking (`running`, `needs-input`, `idle`, `completed`, `error`, `canceled`).
  - **Versioned Continual Self-Refinement (`src/services/refinement/`)**: 3-stage promotion gate (`proposed` ➔ `verified` ➔ `active`) for memory, taste, and skills with instant rollback support.
- **Hybrid Code Search (`src/services/codeSearch/`)**: Cursor-style semantic + keyword retrieval over codebase chunks. Reuses the Repo Map symbol extractor for chunking; indexes into a per-project SQLite DB (`.clew/cache/code_search.db`) with **two retrieval legs** — FTS5/BM25 over identifiers+signatures and sqlite-vec KNN over local embeddings (shared granite-embedding model) — fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Incremental mtime-based sync, embedding circuit breaker (falls back to FTS-only when the model is unavailable and backfills vectors later), and new `/code-search` command (`<query>`, `stats`, `refresh`). 9 unit tests covering query sanitization, RRF fusion math, and formatting.

- **Enhanced Terminal Table & Markdown Rendering**: Integrated `cli-table3` into `MarkdownTable.tsx` for pixel-perfect Unicode box-drawing tables with top-aligned multi-line cells and intelligent Card/List fallback for cramped terminals. Upgraded `wrapAnsi.ts` with native `Intl.Segmenter` support to prevent severing Thai, Lao, and Indic combining vowels and tone marks.
- **Aider-Style Repo Map System (`src/repomap/`)**: Extracted high-level AST structural signatures, interfaces, and exported types into a compact, token-budgeted snapshot (~1,000–1,500 tokens) with incremental `mtime` cache (`.clew/cache/repomap.json`), reducing repetitive file searches and token-heavy reads. Integrated dynamic `<repo_map>` system prompt section and added interactive `/repomap` command (`view`, `refresh`, `status`).
- **Dynamic Tool Masking (`src/utils/toolMasking.ts`)**: Implemented mode-aware tool filtering in API request payloads (`default`, `plan`, `read-only`, `minimal`). In plan and read-only modes, destructive write and execution tools (`FileEdit`, `FileWrite`, `Bash`, etc.) are masked, saving ~3,000–5,000 tokens on every prompt payload.
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible cached prompt tokens being counted twice in context usage, cost analytics, and auto-compact thresholds.
- **Context meter / Auto-Compact alignment**: The warning meter and status-line `ctx` value now use the same full-context estimator and raw model window. Removed the hardcoded `auto-compacts at 80%` label; the UI displays each model's actual trigger percentage and changes to `auto-compact pending` after crossing it, including during active tool chains.

- **Complete Taste Learning System (Phases 1 – 6)**: Implemented full Taste Learning engine (`src/taste/`) to learn and adapt to user conventions, coding styles, and workflow habits:
  - **Storage & Evidence**: Dual-scoped SQLite backend (`.clew/taste/taste.db` & `~/.clew/taste/taste.db`) with `taste_rules`, `taste_evidence`, and `taste_conflicts` tables.
  - **Evidence Collector & Sanitizer**: Automatic secret scanner/redaction and signal weight heuristic matrix (`accept`, `reject`, `revert`, `test_pass`, `build_pass`, `lint_pass`, `review_accept`).
  - **Semantic Diff & Workflow Learner**: Detects export styles, explicit typing, surgical vs broad diffs, and tool invocation sequences (`search -> read -> edit`, targeted testing).
  - **Confidence Engine & Lifecycle**: Dynamic lifecycle transitions (`candidate` 0.30–0.59 -> `weak` 0.60–0.79 -> `active` >=0.80) with conflict detection.
  - **Context Compiler & Commands**: Injects compact `<clew_taste>` blocks; extended `/taste` command with `evidence <id>`, `conflicts`, `inspect`, `add`, `remove`, `disable`, `enable`, `clear`.
  - **Unit Test Suite**: 21 unit tests covering all phases (store CRUD, scoring, evidence sanitization, diff analysis, confidence lifecycle, closed-loop learner).
- **Removed the project rules system**: Deleted the `ProjectRule` tool (`src/tools/ProjectRuleTool/`), `/rule` slash command (`src/commands/rule/`), `.clew/rules.json` loading util (`src/utils/projectRules.ts`), its system-prompt section, startup chat notification, and footer rule-count indicator. Clew Code no longer reads or writes `.clew/rules.json`.
- **Unified provider model discovery**: The provider setup wizard now uses the same registry-aware live model fetcher and response parser as `/model`, so providers with nonstandard catalog URLs (including Cline) show the same current model list instead of stale static entries.


## [0.8.7] - 2026-08-27

- **Clean-install memory compaction**: `compactContext()` now creates `.clew/memory/` before writing durable Markdown files, preventing `ENOENT` failures on fresh installations and clean CI runners.
- **Basic Tools Hardening & Test Coverage**:
  - Added unit test suites for basic tools (`FileReadTool`, `FileEditTool`, `GlobTool`, `GrepTool`, and task management utilities `src/utils/tasks.ts`).
  - Resolved circular dependency between `GlobTool` and `GrepTool` by directly importing `renderToolResultMessage` from UI layer.
  - Hardened quote normalization, whitespace stripping, and curly-quote preservation in `FileEditTool`.
  - Added a compact live subagent roster below the main REPL logo and a Claude-style `← N agents` footer entry that always counts the main conversation as agent 1. Left now moves the conversation into a branded background room with the Clew mascot, live Needs input / Working / Completed groups, and a bottom task composer; removed the redundant `/sessions` command and kept the existing `/session` command.

- **Frontend Consolidation & Settings API Modernization**:
  - Re-exported `AgentValidationResult` from `validateAgent.ts` in `agents/types.ts` to eliminate duplicate type declarations.
  - Migrated reactive UI components (`ConsoleOAuthFlow`, `MCPServerApprovalDialog`, `MCPServerMultiselectDialog`, `HooksConfigMenu`, `SandboxSettings`) from legacy `getSettings_DEPRECATED()` to the modern, reactive `useSettings()` hook.

- **Agent & Sub-Agent System Hardening**:
  - Added comprehensive regression and unit tests for `AgentTool`, `loadAgentsDir`, `agentToolUtils`, and `LocalAgentTask`.
  - Standardized `AgentToolResult` to enforce unified `status` (`completed | failed | blocked | canceled`), structured `evidence`, and verified `filesChanged`.
  - Hardened end-to-end abort signal propagation across subagents, tool loops, and background tasks.
  - Implemented an active in-memory `FileLeaseTracker` (`src/utils/fileLease.ts`) to prevent concurrent file write conflicts across subagents and teammates with automatic lease release on task completion/cancellation.

- **Dead-code cleanup**: Removed the unreferenced `ModelDiscoveryService` implementation and the unused `context/memoryStore` database facade. The model picker now reads the shared provider registry directly.
- **Model picker live refresh**: `/model` now fetches model lists for every configured provider whenever the picker is opened, so newly added provider models appear without restarting Clew Code.
- **Cline live model discovery**: Updated Cline's removed `/api/v1/models` URL to the authenticated `/api/v1/ai/cline/models` catalog endpoint, restoring the full current model list in `/model` instead of silently falling back to stale static entries.
- **Model picker free-model discovery**: `/model` now recognizes free models from common provider metadata, zero-cost OpenRouter pricing, `:free` model IDs, and free labels instead of relying only on static registry tags.
- **`/model` reset and help improvements**: `/model default` now clears both the session model and provider overlays, and `/model --help` documents session selection, global defaults, provider-qualified models, reset, and live model listing.
- **Removed `/model-router` and `/model-fallback` Commands**: Cleaned the task-mode routing system and custom model fallback chain in favor of straightforward `/model` selection and core provider retry resilience.
- **Removed `/mode` Command & Behavioral Modes Subsystem**: Deleted the `/mode` command, `src/modes/` subsystem, settings schema fields, and the dynamic `mode` system prompt section to streamline session configuration.
- **Auto-Compact v2 & `/compact` Command Unification**: Fixed recursion guard collision between manual `/compact` and inner summarization subagents (`compact_summarize`), added forced/manual compaction options to Auto-Compact v2 planner to execute custom instructions cleanly without falling back to legacy paths, and passed complete cache-sharing parameters to optimize prompt cache reuse.
- **Auto-Compact controls**: Fixed manual `/compact` being blocked when only automatic compaction was disabled, and surfaced reducer failures as a compaction shortfall so the user receives an actionable warning instead of a silent over-limit request.
- **Comprehensive Dead Code & Orphaned File Cleanup**: Pruned 74 unreferenced files including legacy agent creation wizards (`src/components/agents/new-agent-creation/`), dead memory/UI components, unregistered commands, deprecated services, and unused hooks/utilities.
- **Export Consolidation & Encapsulation**: Removed redundant default exports across tools (`TaskOutputTool`, `MonitorTool`, `FileIndex`, `MonitorPermissionRequest`, `ComputerUseDoctorSection`), deleted unused legacy `*PendingNotifications` and `submitPermissionRequest` aliases, and encapsulated internal functions/constants in `auth.ts`, `client.ts`, and `compact.ts`.
- **Removed the Xenova Transformers/sharp install dependency**: semantic memory search now degrades gracefully when the optional embedding runtime is unavailable, so the CLI can start without native image modules.
- **System Prompt Modernization & Prefix Cache Optimization**: Cleaned legacy boilerplate in static system prompt sections, locked immutable static blocks before `SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY` for 100% prompt cache hit rates, and upgraded `CODING_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to enforce codebase inspection, surgical diffs, and test verification.
- **Subagents & Dead Code Pruning**: Removed redundant `rlm` agent, `JsonPathTool`, and `ParallelSearchReadTool`. Streamlined built-in subagent prompts (`Explore`, `Plan`, `Verification`) for fast, non-overlapping synthesis.
- **`/model` now follows the provider you picked from**: choosing a model out of a provider's group in the picker (or running `/model openai/gpt-5.5`) switches the session to that provider instead of sending the bare model id to whatever provider was already active. Session picks go through ProviderManager's in-memory overlay — the same mechanism `/providers` uses — so `provider.json` and other terminals are untouched; only "set as default" writes to disk. The Ctrl-key model picker in the prompt input had the same bug in a worse form (it stored the raw `provider/model` string as the default model) and is fixed too. The status message now names the provider.
- **Removed the LAN peer system**: deleted the entire peer subsystem — 19 peer tools, the `src/peer` engine, the `/peer` command, peer UI components (`PeerIndicator`, `PeerStatusLine`), and the `usePeerAutoInject`/`peerSync` hooks. Swarm/teammate and Remote Control features are preserved. The `clew-peer` MCP server entry was removed from `.mcp.json` and `AGENTS.md`/`README.md` were updated.


## [0.8.6] - 2026-08-12

- **Ink rendering fix**: removed unnecessary `<Text>` wrapper from `RemoteSessionProgress` in `isRemoteReview` case that created component nesting conflicts.
- **API retry system improvements**: reduced `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES` from 10 to 3 (fail fast, prevent infinite loops), increased `BASE_DELAY_MS` from 500ms to 1s, added 60-second global timeout across all retry attempts, improved exponential backoff with conservative 8-second cap, reduced jitter from 25% to 10%, removed infinite-loop bug in persistent mode, better error classification for faster failure on non-retryable errors.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-08-11

- **New `/delegate` command**: runs one subagent synchronously (default agent: `rlm`) and shows its result. Pass an agent type as the first token to delegate to a different agent. Renders a live progress panel while the agent runs (elapsed time, tool/token counts, latest tool activity, Esc/q to cancel) instead of sitting silent until completion.
- **New `scored-tool` compact reducer**: model-guided eviction of old tool results — asks the LLM which compactable tool results are safe to forget, falling back to stale-tool recency when the model path is unavailable. Sits between `stale-tool` (0.2) and `snip` (0.35) in loss at 0.3.
- **Auto-compact v2 polish**: boundary wait disabled (compact fires immediately regardless of conversation boundary), adaptive buffer replaced with a static 40K-token buffer for consistent threshold behavior, dead `isBoundaryCompactEnabled()` code removed, and `resolveAdaptiveBuffer()` simplified to a zero-arg function.
- **Per-agent compaction health**: shortfalls, restores, and compact counts are now scoped to each `CompactSessionState` instead of a shared module-level singleton, so concurrent agents no longer corrupt each other's health tracking.
- **RLM agent tightened**: file-editing tools (`FileWrite`, `FileEdit`, `NotebookEdit`) are now in `disallowedTools` and `CLAUDE.md` is omitted (`omitClaudeMd: true`) — the RLM agent delegates and synthesizes only. Edge cases (all-strand failure, context-limit synthesis, recursion-boundary guard) documented in the system prompt.
- **`isMemoryFilePath` refactor**: `compact.ts` now uses the existing `isMemoryFilePath()` utility instead of manually mapping `MEMORY_TYPE_VALUES` to expanded paths.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-08-09

- **New built-in `rlm` agent**: RLM-style recursive agent that decomposes a task into independent strands, delegates each to a spawned subagent in parallel, and synthesizes one report.
- **New `LSP explore` operation**: one call takes symbol names or a question and returns the matching symbols' verbatim source (line-numbered, ready to hand to Edit) grouped by file, plus who calls each one. It replaces the usual Grep+Read+hunt-for-callers loop when you need to understand or safely change code. Built as aggregation over the LSP primitives the tool already had — `workspace/symbol`, the files on disk, and `callHierarchy/incomingCalls` — so there is no index, no daemon, and no staleness window; results always reflect what is on disk. Only reports symbols defined inside the project, and applies the same gitignore filtering as the existing operations.
- **`/peer` command and `peer_help` guide describe what a peer is** and now cover the real model-facing surface: peers are other Clew machines on your LAN (not `--agent` subagents), and the guide documents `peer_manage` actions, `peer_exec` fan-out/filter/priority/dependsOn, broker mode, chunking, and automatic message delivery — replacing the old Thai guide that referenced the eleven single-verb tools consolidated behind `peer_manage`.
- **Peer terminology no longer overloads "swarm"**: `src/peer/types.ts` used "swarm" in its doc comments to mean a single peer machine, while `/peer swarm` means the fan-out across every connected peer. The comments now say "peer", and the internal `SwarmStatus`/`SwarmTask`/`PersistedSwarmTasks` types are `PeerStatus`/`PeerTask`/`PersistedPeerTasks`. The `clew-swarm-query`/`clew-swarm-info` discovery message types are unchanged on the wire to stay compatible with older peers.
- **`peer_broadcast` no longer points the model at a tool it cannot call** (`peer_list_roles`); it now says `peer_manage({ action: "list" })` and clarifies it sends AI prompts, not shell commands.
- **Dropped 12 dead tool imports from `src/tools.ts`**: `PeerRunTool`, `PeerSwarmTool`, `PeerSpawnTool`, `PeerListAllTool` and the other single-verb peer tools were imported but never registered — `PeerExecTool` and `PeerManageTool` import their own delegates.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-08-09

- **Prompt suggestions now appear after the first completed turn** and no longer treat cached prompt tokens as uncached work, preventing normal long sessions from permanently suppressing suggestions.

- **WebFetch no longer depends on Anthropic domain-info uptime**: when the advisory preflight service times out or is unreachable, public URL fetches continue through the existing local URL and redirect SSRF checks; explicitly blocked domains remain blocked.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-09

- **Model/provider global defaults**: press `g` while selecting a model to save it globally, or choose “Save as global default” after selecting a provider and one of that provider’s models; session-only selection remains available.
- **`/init` wording**: generated documentation now refers to `AGENTS.md`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-09

- **fix: stop the recap firing with no conversation, and while you are watching**: long-turn recaps now require a real user turn and assistant reply, and remain suppressed while the terminal is focused or the focus state is unknown.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-09

- **fix: `clew --version` reported a stale version**: `main.tsx` reads `./generated/version.json` relative to `import.meta.url` at runtime — it is not inlined by the bundler — so from `dist/main.js` that resolves to `dist/generated/version.json`, and the `globalThis.MACRO` it sets overrode the value the postbuild preamble injected. `prebuild-version.mjs` only writes `src/generated/`, so the dist copy was whatever the very first build left behind: 0.6.8, 0.7.0 and 0.7.1 all reported `0.7.0`. The postbuild step now writes `dist/generated/version.json` from the same `package.json` the preamble uses.
- **Dependency audit cleared (19 vulnerabilities → 0 actionable)**: CI's audit job had been red since before this release. Three of the advisories were held open by our own `overrides` block, which pinned `fast-uri`, `hono` and `ip-address` to the exact versions the advisories name. Bumped `undici` to `^8.10.0` and the pins to `fast-uri 4.1.2` / `hono 4.13.1` / `ip-address 10.4.0`, and added overrides for `brace-expansion 5.0.9`, `@hono/node-server 2.1.0` (a version `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` declares support for) and `body-parser 2.3.0`. One advisory remains ignored with its reasoning recorded at the ignore site: `sharp <0.35.0` is unreachable — `@xenova/transformers` pins `^0.32.0` and its maintained successor pins `^0.34.5`, both below the fix, and bun does not support nested overrides.
- **Auto-compact shortfall is now visible**: `shortfall` — the planner spending every reducer and still not freeing what it needed — is the only route from auto-compact v2 to a `prompt_too_long`, and it previously went to analytics and nowhere else. It now raises a REPL warning with the actual numbers, adds a Compaction line to `/context`, and counts `ContextRestore` calls (restore rate is the quality signal that replaced the compact-regret loop v2 removed).
- **Long-turn recap threshold raised from 3 to 5 minutes**, in both the default constant and the shipped config default.

- **`/mode`**: named behavioral presets that change how Clew works a task without changing what it can do. Seven built-ins (`roleplay`, `socratic`, `brainstorm`, `reviewer`, `concise`, `pair`, `architect`), a picker when run bare, and `/mode <name> | off | list`. Define your own in `.clew/modes/*.md` (project) or `~/.clew/modes/*.md` (user) — project overrides user overrides built-in. The active mode is a `systemPromptSection('mode', …)` keyed on the mode name, so switching mid-session rebuilds only that section instead of busting the whole prompt cache. Persists via the new `mode` setting; `CLEW_CODE_MODE` overrides it for one session.
- **Tool surface consolidated (54 → 40 enabled tools)**: the peer feature shipped 18 always-on top-level tools, so every session paid for 18 tool descriptions whether or not it touched a peer. Eleven single-verb admin calls (`peer_share`, `peer_ping`, `peer_set_role`, …) folded into `peer_manage({ action })`, and `peer_run` + `peer_swarm` merged into `peer_exec` (naming a peer runs on it; omitting one fans out). Separately, `CronCreate`/`CronDelete`/`CronList`/`ScheduleFollowup` became one `Schedule({ action })` — four descriptions for what the model treats as a single capability, with the most useful one (`followup`, which carries your working context forward) buried behind the others. All of these are facades: the original tools keep their implementations, schemas and renderers and are dispatched to by action, so no peer or scheduling behavior was re-implemented.
- **`peer_dashboard` removed**: its task view is now part of `peer_manage({ action: "list" })`. The roster and the dashboard answered the same question and overlapped almost entirely, which left the model choosing between two near-identical tools. `/peer dashboard` is unchanged.
- **`CHICAGO_MCP` enabled**: switched from the ignored `--define.CHICAGO_MCP=true` to `--feature CHICAGO_MCP`. This compiles in the Computer Use surface (the `--computer-use-mcp` subcommand, reserved-MCP-name validation, and turn-end cleanup) but does **not** turn Computer Use on: every activating site is additionally gated on `getChicagoEnabled()`, which still defaults to false. Set `ENABLE_COMPUTER_USE=1` to actually use it.
- **`VOICE_MODE` and `AWAY_SUMMARY` enabled**: both were passed as `--define.NAME=true`, which `bun:bundle` ignores, so they had never actually shipped on. Now passed as `--feature`. Turning voice on exposed a latent crash: `loadAudioNapi()` rejected when the optional native `audio-capture-napi` dependency was missing, and `startRecordingSession()` is invoked as a bare `void` promise — so a machine without the native module would have hit an unhandled rejection instead of the "native audio module could not be loaded" message the code already had branches for. It now degrades to a stub whose `isNativeAudioAvailable()` is false, and both dynamic `import('services/voice.js')` sites carry a `.catch`.
- **Scheduling tools enabled**: `ScheduleFollowup` ("come back to this in N minutes"), `CronCreate`, `CronDelete` and `CronList` were implemented but shipped disabled — `feature('AGENT_TRIGGERS')` was never turned on, so `isKairosCronEnabled()` returned false and every one of them reported `isEnabled(): false`. The build script passed `--define.NAME=true`, which `bun:bundle` silently ignores; the flag is now passed as `--feature AGENT_TRIGGERS`, and `scripts/bun-run.mjs` enables it in dev too.
- **Auto-compact v2**: replaced the six independent context-reduction mechanisms (tool-result budget, snip, time-based and duplicate microcompact, session memory, full compact) with one planner. It measures pressure once against a single `ContextLedger`, then spends reducers cheapest-loss-first (`dedupe` → `stale-tool` → `snip` → `summarize` → `drop`) until the token deficit is covered — so a tool-heavy session no longer gets summarized wholesale when deduping would have sufficed. Everything evicted is written to a per-session store and left as a one-line stub the model can pull back with the new `ContextRestore` tool. Removed with it: the background pre-compaction job, the compact-regret feedback loop, the turn-count cooldown and the failure circuit breaker — each existed to work around a limitation the new design does not have. See `docs/architecture/auto-compact-v2.md`.
- **fix: `initExtractMemories is not a function` on dev-mode startup**: `backgroundHousekeeping`, `query/stopHooks` and `cli/print` `require()`d `services/extractMemories`, but `services/autoDream` imports it as ESM unconditionally — and in Bun, `require()` of a module the ESM loader has already evaluated returns an empty object. All three now import it statically. Only reproduced with `--feature EXTRACT_MEMORIES` (dev), which is why the production build never showed it.
- **Effort indicator moved right**: `● high · /effort` now renders in the prompt footer's right-hand slot next to the other persistent status indicators instead of the left notification column.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-09

- **AGENTS.md canonical again**: consolidated the repo guidance into a single `AGENTS.md` (refreshed build commands, typecheck baseline 1867, tests); `AGENT.md` and `CLAUDE.md` now point to it; README links updated. Parent-level `D:\Projects\Github\AGENTS.md` (stale, npm/vitest-era) deleted.
- **AGENTS.md system prompt flow**: documented the two-layer prompt build (selection via `buildEffectiveSystemPrompt` + assembly via `getSystemPrompt`), the dynamic section registry, and the side prompts.
- **fix: `/effort` clamp for OpenAI-compatible providers**: `xhigh`/`max` effort (valid for Claude 4.6/4.7) now map to `high` `reasoning_effort` instead of being forwarded as-is — OpenAI-compatible gateways (opencode, deepseek, nvidia, …) rejected them with a 400. Unknown levels are skipped instead of forwarded.
- **fix: dedupe `reasoning_content` in `assistantMessageToMessageParam`**: when the assistant content already carries a thinking block (added by `normalizeMessagesForAPI` from the stored reasoning), the top-level `reasoning_content` field is no longer re-added — the same text was sent twice. The field is still emitted when reasoning has nowhere else to live (e.g. tool-call assistants).
- **fix: `normalizeMessagesForAPI` reasoning dedupe**: a `redacted_thinking` block now counts as reasoning content, so the normalizer no longer synthesizes a second thinking block holding the same `reasoning_content` text.
- **fix: keep Gemini thinking parts out of non-streaming CodeAssist content**: `fromCodeAssistResponse` joined every part's `text` including reasoning parts marked `thought: true`, leaking reasoning into the assistant message. It now filters them, matching `handleSSEStream`.
- **`/taste pull` now says "Pulled"**: the direction verb was hardcoded to "Pushed" even for the pull (global→project) direction.

- **Taste overlay**: `Ctrl+C` now closes the TASTE window without interrupting the active agent turn.

### Fixed
- Prevented prompt-history lock cleanup errors from becoming unhandled rejections when the lock disappears during shutdown or stale-lock recovery.
- Suppressed expected shell parser errors such as `Bad substitution: ${}` during Bash permission validation; malformed commands still return a failed parse result and follow the existing safety path.

- **Forced `NODE_ENV=test` for `bun test` via `bunfig.toml` preload**: `bun test` only assigns `NODE_ENV=test` when the variable is unset, so a shell exporting `NODE_ENV=production` (e.g. inherited from a build step) left the codebase's `NODE_ENV === 'test'` guards disabled and made `resetStateForTests()` throw, failing the `getTranscriptPathForSession` tests. A `bunfig.toml` `[test] preload` now forces test mode before tests run, so `bun test` is deterministic regardless of the inherited environment. (`bunfig.toml`, `test-setup.ts`)
- Preserved OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_content` across assistant tool-call round trips so thinking-mode providers no longer reject follow-up requests.
- **`/peer health` was advertised but never implemented** — `/peer help` listed it, yet the command fell through to `Unknown: /peer health`. It now prints a health table (name, role, health, latency, load, address) with a healthy/lagging/offline summary. (`src/commands/peer/peer.tsx`, `src/peer/peerDashboard.ts`)
- **`/peer swarm` printed nothing on a real run** — `runSwarm` built the `SwarmResult` element but the call site discarded its return value, and `peer.tsx` never imported `React` despite calling `React.createElement`, so the code path would have thrown had it been reached. Per-peer swarm output now renders. (`src/commands/peer/peer.tsx`)
- **Peer send/task failures crashed instead of reporting** — the `catch` blocks in `sendMessage`/`sendTask` referenced `peer`, which was `const`-declared inside the `try`, so an unreachable peer produced a `ReferenceError` instead of the intended `Could not reach <peer>` message. (`src/commands/peer/peer.tsx`)
- **Tasks from disconnected peers vanished from the dashboard** — todos whose sender was no longer a connected peer were silently dropped from the peer grouping. They now appear under an `Unassigned` bucket and are counted in the totals. (`src/peer/peerDashboard.ts`)
- Restored queue-operation type contracts and narrowed session context handling in session persistence, reducing the TypeScript baseline by five errors.
- Narrowed message helper types for normalized assistant messages and typed attachment variants, reducing the TypeScript baseline by 55 errors without changing runtime behavior.
- Added missing metadata to stream, API error, and normalized user message variants, reducing the TypeScript baseline by 7 additional errors.
- Reduced provider/API type debt by restoring connector-text delta types, carrying abort signals through retry contexts, and typing streamed events and normalized usage boundaries.
- Fixed duplicate `SDKControlInitializeResponse` import in `src/cli/print.ts` — it was imported from both `agentSdkTypes.js` (which does not export it) and `controlTypes.js`, causing TS2206/TS2300/TS2305 errors; also removed the now-unused `ModelInfo` import after the `modelInfos` parameter type switched to `SDKControlInitializeResponse['models']`, and added the missing `as UUID` casts on `message.uuid` at the two call sites the changeset had initially missed. (`src/cli/print.ts`)
- Exported `buildUnifiedModelOptions` from `src/components/ModelPicker.tsx` so the co-located test suite can import and exercise it. (`src/components/ModelPicker.tsx`, `src/components/ModelPicker.test.ts`)

### Added
- **Live peer dashboard** (`/peer dashboard`): the static text block is now an interactive Ink view that refreshes every 2s — a peer table with health, latency, queue load, and task count, plus a detail pane showing the selected peer's todos and the replies they returned. Arrow keys select a peer, `p` filters to pending tasks, `r` forces a refresh, `Esc`/`q` closes. `/peer dashboard --text` still prints the static snapshot for copying, and the AI-facing `PeerDashboard` tool is unchanged in shape. Both renderers now read one shared model (`collectPeerDashboard`) instead of the tool scraping counts back out of rendered text with regexes, so the numbers can't disagree. `/peer` menu gained a `Dashboard` entry. (`src/peer/peerDashboard.ts`, `src/commands/peer/PeerDashboard.tsx`, `src/commands/peer/peer.tsx`, `src/commands/peer/PeerMenu.tsx`, `src/tools/PeerDashboardTool/PeerDashboardTool.ts`)
- **Model fallback chain** (`/model-fallback`, `src/utils/model/fallbackChain.ts`): the single hardcoded fallback model is now an ordered, user-configured chain of `{provider?, model, effort?}` entries. When the primary model keeps hitting transient capacity errors, Clew walks the chain instead of giving up after one hop, and each entry can carry its own reasoning effort so a cheaper fallback also thinks less. `/model-fallback` lists the chain; `add <provider|-> <model> [effort]`, `remove <n>`, `move <from> <to>`, and `clear` edit it. Automatic failover is same-provider only — entries pinned to another provider are skipped during a retry and apply from the next query onward, since switching providers mid-request would mutate a process-global that leaks into concurrent subagents. With no chain configured the previous single-fallback behavior is unchanged. (`src/utils/model/fallbackChain.ts`, `src/services/api/withRetry.ts`, `src/services/api/claude.ts`, `src/query.ts`, `src/commands/model-fallback/`)
- **Task-mode model router** (`/model-router`, `src/utils/model/router.ts`): route different kinds of work to different models — e.g. Opus for planning, a fast cheap model for debugging — without retyping `/model` on every switch. The task mode is inferred from the permission mode you are already in (`plan`→plan, `bypassPermissions`/`auto`→orchestrator, `default`/`acceptEdits`→code, `ask`→ask, `dontAsk`→debug), so there is no second mode selector to keep in sync. `/model-router` shows the routing table and which permission mode triggers each row; `set <mode> <provider|-> <model> [effort]` and `unset <mode>` edit it. An explicit `/model` choice for the session always wins over routing. (`src/utils/model/router.ts`, `src/utils/model/model.ts`, `src/commands/model-router/`)
- **Prompt enhancement**: `Ctrl+E` enhances the current input prompt via Claude to make it clearer, more specific, and better-structured. The current model is used for enhancement. A dialog shows the original and enhanced versions; press `Enter` to apply or `Esc` to cancel. Enhancement can be aborted at any time. (`src/services/promptEnhancement.ts`, `src/components/PromptEnhancementDialog.tsx`)
- **Taste — category-based organization, push/pull, and lint**: Taste entries are now bucketed into domain categories (`cli`, `typescript`, `architecture`, `general`), mirroring the `.commandcode/taste/` package layout. The injected `# Taste` block groups preferences by category so the model applies them in context. `/taste push [cat]` copies project→global preferences (skipping duplicates), `/taste pull [cat]` copies global→project, `/taste lint` validates both TASTE.md files for malformed lines, missing dates, out-of-range confidence, and unknown categories. The `TASTE Learned` card now shows the category. All commands support an optional category filter. Backward-compatible: entries without a category bracket parse as `general`. (`src/services/taste/`, `src/commands/taste/`, `src/components/messages/SystemTextMessage.tsx`)
- **Taste — learned standing preferences** (`src/services/taste/`): Clew now picks up how you want replies shaped — the language and length you write in, the form of the output, how much to ask before deciding — and applies it on every turn without being reminded. Learning rides on the existing memory-extraction fork rather than paying for its own pass; the agent reports observations as a fenced ` ```taste ` block, which the host validates and writes (the fork's write allowlist covers only the auto-memory directory, so it cannot write TASTE.md itself). Entries carry a confidence: `global` ones land in `<memoryBaseDir>/memory/TASTE.md`, `project` ones in the `.clew/memory/TASTE.md` the manual `preferred` feedback signal already used. Only entries at 60%+ confidence are injected — below that they are recorded so a later observation can raise them, but they do not steer behavior. Each new preference surfaces as a `TASTE Learned` card you can confirm (raises to certain) or reject (deletes). `/taste` lists them, `/taste forget <n>` removes one, `/taste on|off` toggles. Follows auto-memory's enablement, since it shares that fork. (`src/services/taste/`, `src/commands/taste/`, `src/constants/prompts.ts`, `src/components/messages/SystemTextMessage.tsx`)
- **MCP task-augmented tool calls (spec revision 2025-11-25)**: A server can mark a tool `execution.taskSupport: 'optional' | 'required'`, meaning `tools/call` returns a task handle and the result is fetched later. Nothing supported this before — a `required` tool could not be called at all, because the SDK's `client.callTool()` throws for them. Task-capable tools now run through `client.experimental.tasks.callToolStream()`, with status updates surfaced as tool progress and no wall-clock timeout (outliving a normal request is the point of a task; the caller's abort signal is the only cancellation path). Task metadata is recorded from the paginated `tools/list` loop, which bypasses `client.listTools()` and so never filled the SDK's own cache. (`src/services/mcp/tasks.ts`, `src/services/mcp/client.ts`)

### Changed
- **Faster typechecking**: `tsconfig.json` now sets `incremental: true`, so repeat `bun x tsc --noEmit` runs reuse cached type information for unchanged files — measured ~75s cold to ~18s warm on this repo, with an identical error set. The cache lands in `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, already covered by `.gitignore`. Also dropped the now-unnecessary `baseUrl` in favour of a relative `paths` entry (`./src/*`); `tsc` has supported `paths` without `baseUrl` since TS 4.4, and TS 6.0 removes `baseUrl` outright, so this is one less thing to migrate later. (`tsconfig.json`)
- Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to 1.30.0. The negotiated protocol revision is `2025-11-25`.
- **MCP elicitation now declares both modes**: The client declared `elicitation: {}`, which spec revision 2025-11-25 reads as form-only — leaving the URL-mode handler in `elicitationHandler.ts` unreachable. Both modes are implemented, so both are declared (`{form: {}, url: {}}`). Known incompatibility: older Java MCP SDK servers (Spring AI) model `Elicitation` as a zero-field class that rejects unknown properties and will fail to initialize against this. (`src/services/mcp/client.ts`)
- **`/model` shows every provider in one list**: The picker used to render one provider at a time, with `Tab` swapping the whole list — so finding a model meant knowing which of the 32 providers it lived under. All ~127 registry models are now in a single scrollable list grouped by provider (active provider first, `Recent` above it), with the capability description in an aligned second column. `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` now jump between provider groups instead of replacing the list, search matches across every provider and keeps matching group headers, and rows are keyed `provider/model` so same-id models under different providers stay distinct. (`src/components/ModelPicker.tsx`)
- Set automatic away and long-turn recap defaults to 3 minutes.


### Fixed
- **Rebuilt `src/types/message.ts` message type system**: `Message` is now a proper discriminated union (was an interface with `[key: string]: unknown`, which made every field access `unknown`). Added the ~25 missing exported types (`NormalizedMessage`/`NormalizedUserMessage`/`NormalizedAssistantMessage`, `MessageOrigin`, `HookResultMessage`, `RenderableMessage`, `TombstoneMessage`, `ToolUseSummaryMessage`, `RequestStartEvent`, `GroupedToolUseMessage`, `CollapsedReadSearchGroup`, the `System*` subtype messages, `ShellProgress`, bridge/control protocol messages, etc.) with shapes derived from their construction sites in `src/utils/messages.ts`. Fixed `ProgressMessage` to be generic with a required `data` field, allowed user message `content` to be `string | ContentBlock[]`, and corrected `isMedia` to accept any typed block. Reduces the tsc error baseline by ~516 errors.

### Removed
- **Ant-only stubs and dead scaffolding removed**: Deleted placeholder `.js` modules (`cachedMicrocompact.js`, `contextCollapse/index.js`, `protectedNamespace.js`, `AssistantSessionChooser.js`, `SnapshotUpdateDialog.js`, `ink/devtools.js`, `commands/assistant/assistant.js`) and their feature-gated call paths (`CACHED_MICROCOMPACT` cache-editing layer in `microCompact.ts`/`claude.ts`/`query.ts`, `CONTEXT_COLLAPSE` drain/recovery in `query.ts`/`autoCompact.ts`/`TokenWarning.tsx`/`ContextVisualization.tsx`, KAIROS assistant viewer block in `main.tsx`, `resetMicrocompactState` call sites). These features were gated off in external builds and their real implementations were never in this repo, so the stubs were dead code that would crash if the flags were ever enabled. Also removed a stale inline sourcemap from `dialogLaunchers.tsx` and the dead `cacheEditingHeaderLatched` state. `.ts-error-baseline` restored (was deleted in 7f79c59a, breaking the CI typecheck comparison).

### Fixed
- **`peer_send_message` ignored `useBroker`**: Explicit broker sends now use the existing broker queue and correlated reply endpoint instead of silently falling back to direct `/peer-msg` delivery. (`src/tools/PeerSendMessageTool/PeerSendMessageTool.ts`)
- **Shared SDK type barrels omitted schema-backed exports**: Restored SDK/control type exports from their Zod schemas and the missing GitHub App installer state types, reducing repository type debt without changing runtime behavior. (`src/entrypoints/agentSdkTypes.ts`, `src/entrypoints/sdk/`, `src/commands/install-github-app/types.ts`)

## [0.6.8] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- **`/model vendor/model` silently dropped the vendor prefix and sent an invalid model id**: `/model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` confirmed "Set model to `deepseek-v4-flash`" and then every request failed with `400 invalid model format. Expected format: modelType/model`. The `/model` arg parser treated the first `/`-segment as a provider switch whenever it matched a registered provider id (`deepseek`, `openai`, `minimax`, `google`, …), stripping it — but Cline uses OpenRouter-style ids where `vendor/` is part of the model name. Both parse sites now share `resolveModelSelection`, which keeps the input whole when the current provider already exposes that exact id, and only treats the prefix as a provider switch otherwise. (`src/commands/model/model.tsx`)
- **npm→native deprecation notice nagged on every launch, including native installs**: The startup banner had no "seen" persistence, so it re-showed for its full 15s every session, and its only gate was `installationType === 'development'` — meaning `native` and `package-manager` installs got told to "switch from npm" despite already having done so. It now shows at most once per version (persisted as `npmDeprecationNoticeSeenVersion` in global config) and only to genuine `npm-global`/`npm-local` installs. (`src/hooks/notifs/useNpmDeprecationNotification.tsx`, `src/utils/config.ts`)
- **Google Antigravity OAuth login / browser improvements**:
  - Exchanged `localhost` redirect URI for the official `https://antigravity.google/oauth-callback` to prevent 400 Bad Request errors on the Google consent page.
  - Automatically handles manual auth code pasting when redirecting to a remote endpoint.
  - Corrected percent-encoding for Google OAuth authorize endpoint parameter query string, resolving malformed request issues.
  - Improved PowerShell and cmd browser opener utilities to properly escape URLs containing ampersands (`&`) in query parameters.
- **Empty streaming response fallback**: Prevented crashes when third-party gateways (e.g. Free-tier OpenGateway models) return empty assistant chunks with only usage stats, yielding a fallback empty content block instead.

### Changed
- **Corrected Cline provider model catalog against the live API**: Verified model ids via `api.cline.bot`; only `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` and `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` are actually free. Added the missing `nvidia/…:free` entry and relabeled `minimax/minimax-m3`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b`, and `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` from "(Free)" to "(needs credit)" since they return 402 without credit. (`src/services/ai/providers.json`)
- **Updated Google Antigravity provider endpoint and credentials path**: Replaced `daily-` staging endpoint with production `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` and moved configuration to the `.antigravity` config directory (`~/.antigravity/oauth_creds.json`).
- **Added Gemini 3.6 Flash, Gemini 3.5 Flash, and Gemini 3.1 Pro to Google Antigravity CLI provider**: Added the latest models to the native catalog with proper capabilities and tags.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **`claude-opus-4-8` and `claude-opus-4-7` reported a knowledge cutoff a year early; `claude-sonnet-5` reported none**: `getKnowledgeCutoff`'s fallback branch tests `canonical.includes('claude-opus-4')`, which also matches `claude-opus-4-8`/`4-7`, so both returned `'January 2025'` instead of January 2026. `claude-sonnet-5` matched no branch and fell through to `null`, emitting no cutoff line at all. Both are now supplied by providers.json, which takes precedence over the prefix chain. Values are the "Reliable knowledge cutoff" column from platform.claude.com, matching the convention the existing hardcoded dates already used. (`src/services/ai/providers.json`)

### Changed
- **Knowledge cutoffs populated for 34 of 115 registry models from provider documentation**: Sourced from platform.claude.com (Anthropic), the OpenAI model page, and Google's model documentation, then propagated to the same models as exposed by aggregator providers (OpenRouter, opencode, cline, kilocode, chatgpt). The remaining 81 models — including all DeepSeek V4, Grok, GLM, Qwen3.6, Kimi, MiniMax, Nemotron, Llama, Mistral, Command A and Sonar entries, plus `gpt-5.6-*` and `gemini-1.5-*` — are deliberately left absent because no reliable public cutoff was found; an absent value drops the prompt line, whereas a guess makes the model misstate its own knowledge horizon. Tests pin the sourced values, enforce a `Month YYYY` shape, and assert the unsourced ones stay absent. (`src/services/ai/providers.json`)
- **System prompt model identity is now provider-agnostic, not Anthropic-only**: `getMarketingNameForModel` matched a hardcoded chain of `claude-*` ids and returned `undefined` for everything else, so the Environment section told the model it was `gpt-5.5` rather than `GPT-5.5` — for 111 of the registry's 115 models whose label differs from their raw id. It now falls back to the `label` providers.json already carries for every model. `getKnowledgeCutoff` was likewise `claude-*`-only and silently emitted no cutoff line for any other provider; `ProviderModelInfo` gains an optional `knowledgeCutoff` field that the lookup consults first. That field is deliberately unpopulated: an absent cutoff correctly drops the line, whereas a guessed one makes the model confidently misstate its own knowledge horizon, so values must come from provider documentation. Both lookups share a new `resolveProviderModelInfo`, which tolerates casing, provider prefixes, dated suffixes and the `[1m]` marker, and prefers the longest matching id so `gpt-5.5` can't shadow `gpt-5.5-mini`. Context-window and capability resolution were already registry-driven and needed no change. (`src/services/ai/providerCapabilities.ts`, `src/utils/model/model.ts`, `src/constants/prompts.ts`)
- **Context indicator redesigned from "9% until auto-compact" to a real meter**: The old label was ambiguous in both directions — it reads as "9% used" when 91% actually is, and it counted down to a threshold the user could not see. It now renders `Context █████████░ 91% · 9.2k left · auto-compacts at 80%`, showing consumption, remaining headroom, and the consequence. It surfaces background pre-compaction state (`preparing summary…` / `summary ready`), tells you to run `/compact` when auto-compact is off, and now passes `messages` into `calculateTokenWarningState` so the percentage honors the adaptive threshold instead of disagreeing with when compaction actually fires. Also fixes a latent theming bug where the warning used raw `"red"`/`"yellow"` instead of the `error`/`warning` theme tokens. (`src/components/contextMeter.ts`, `src/components/TokenWarning.tsx`)
- **Auto-compact's existing smart paths are now live instead of dark code**: Natural-boundary timing, adaptive thresholds, and the regret feedback loop were all implemented but unreachable in practice. Boundary-aware compaction now defaults ON (opt out via `CLEW_CODE_BOUNDARY_COMPACT=0` or `boundaryCompact: false`), so compaction no longer fires mid-tool-chain and summarizes away a `tool_use` whose `tool_result` hasn't arrived — the main cause of the model losing its place after an auto-compact; the hard threshold still force-compacts, so headroom stays bounded. Adaptive thresholds no longer require a GrowthBook flag that defaulted to `null` (GrowthBook remains available for remote tuning and can still disable it). The measure-only regret signal now feeds back: repeated post-compact re-fetches shrink the buffer by up to 3 bounded steps so the next compaction fires later and the summarizer sees a more complete tail. (`src/services/compact/autoCompact.ts`)

### Added
- **`/resume` now warns before replaying a large or stale session**: Picking a session worth ≥100k tokens or older than 4 hours now shows "This session is 17h 27m old and 128.7k tokens." with three choices — resume from summary (recommended), resume full session as-is, or don't ask again. The summary path auto-runs `/compact` against the restored transcript via the existing `AppState.initialMessage` seam, so it goes through the real compaction command. The transcript is already loaded from disk when the prompt appears, so declining costs nothing. "Don't ask me again" persists as `skipResumeSizeWarning` in global config. (`src/utils/resumeSizeWarning.ts`, `src/components/ResumeSizeWarning.tsx`, `src/screens/ResumeConversation.tsx`, `src/utils/config.ts`)

### Fixed
- **System prompt kept describing the previous model after a mid-session `/model` switch**: `resolveSystemPromptSections` keyed its memo cache on the section *name* alone, and the cache is only cleared by `/clear`, `/compact`, worktree enter/exit and session restore — never by `/model`. Two cached sections close over the active model: `env_info_simple` emits "You are powered by the model named X. The exact model ID is Y." plus that model's knowledge cutoff and capabilities, and `frc` is gated on `config.supportedModels` matching it. Switching Opus→Sonnet therefore left the model being told it was still Opus, with the wrong knowledge cutoff and capability claims, for the rest of the session. Sections can now declare `deps` that participate in the cache key (NUL-separated so a name containing the dep can't collide), and both model-varying sections declare the model. No added prompt-cache pressure: these sit after `SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY`, and a `/model` switch already changes the request model. (`src/constants/systemPromptSections.ts`, `src/constants/prompts.ts`)
- **`estimateCompressibility` undercounted context, pushing auto-compact toward the ceiling**: It counted a `tool_use` block as only its *name* — discarding `input`, which carries bash commands, Edit diffs, and file contents — and ignored `thinking`/`redacted_thinking` blocks entirely. Both undercounts landed on the denominator only, never on `toolResultTokens`, so the ratio was pushed toward 1, selecting the smallest buffer. On a representative tool-heavy session this reported 0.80 compressibility instead of 0.31 and cost ~14.7k tokens of headroom, firing auto-compact that much closer to the context limit. It now delegates per-block sizing to the canonical `roughTokenCountEstimationForBlock` instead of a hand-rolled duplicate that had drifted. Latent until this release, when adaptive thresholds became live. (`src/services/compact/autoCompact.ts`, `src/services/tokenEstimation.ts`)
- **Removed stray debug logging from the token-count fallback**: `countTokensViaHaikuFallback` carried a `console.error` dumping client-shape internals to stderr on every Haiku fallback token count, left behind by `fdc53610`. (`src/services/tokenEstimation.ts`)
- **Repaired the CodeAssist→Antigravity rename that broke the entire test suite**: `e7c08fef` renamed `CodeAssistProvider` → `AntigravityProvider` and `CODE_ASSIST_*` / `*GeminiOAuthCreds` → `ANTIGRAVITY_*` / `*AntigravityOAuthCreds`, but left three call sites importing the old names. `providerRegistry.ts` imported and instantiated a class that no longer existed, so `SyntaxError: Export named 'CodeAssistProvider' not found` propagated through the import graph and took down every test file that transitively reached it — `bun test` could not run at all. The suite now runs (611 pass). `google-assist` provider selection and the `/login` Code Assist OAuth flow were broken at runtime by the same mismatch. (`src/services/ai/providerRegistry.ts`, `src/components/GoogleOAuthFlow.tsx`, `src/commands/provider-select/provider-select.ts`)
- **Restored 8 packages the dead-code cleanup broke as transitive deps**: `marked`, `yaml`, `supports-hyperlinks`, `cli-highlight`, `plist`, `cacache`, `undici`, and `@aws-sdk/credential-providers` are all imported directly by `src/` but were only present in the tree as transitive dependencies of packages removed in the dead-code cleanup (e.g. `marked` via `ink-markdown`), so CI Build/Test failed with unresolved imports. They are now direct dependencies. (`package.json`, `bun.lock`)

### Removed
- **Removed dead code — unused dependencies, always-null variables, dead tool factories**: 11 unused npm dependencies removed (ink-divider, ink-markdown, ink-select-input, ink-spinner, ink-text-input, is-docker, is-wsl, lucide-react, react-markdown, @opentelemetry/sdk-node, @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node, @ast-grep/cli). Removed 7 always-null variables and their dead conditional branches from `src/commands.ts`. Removed 9 feature-gated tool factories referencing non-existent directories from `src/tools.ts`. (`package.json`, `src/commands.ts`, `src/tools.ts`)

## [0.6.6] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **`/compact` now shows its real in-progress lifecycle, including session-memory compaction**: The REPL set `isCompacting` on progress events but its spinner visibility condition explicitly required `!isCompacting`, hiding the current phase and elapsed time. Compaction now keeps the spinner visible (and takes precedence over streaming text), reports actual lifecycle phases such as hooks and conversation compaction without a fabricated percentage, and reliably clears the same progress lifecycle for session-memory and traditional compaction. (`src/screens/REPL.tsx`, `src/commands/compact/compact.ts`)

## [0.6.5] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- **`/model` no longer changes other sessions**: In the model picker, `Enter` confirmed the focused model by calling the set-as-default path, which wrote the choice to `userSettings` and `provider.json` — so switching model in one terminal changed every other session, including new ones. `Enter` is now session-scoped (as is `s`, kept as an alias), and persisting a default is opt-in via the new `d` shortcut. Effort follows the same rule: selecting a model always applies effort to the running session, but only `d` writes `effortLevel` to `userSettings`. Also fixes a `ReferenceError` on an undeclared `isFastMode` in the `/model <name>` effect deps, which broke the inline form outright, and threads the picker's effort through to the set-as-default handler instead of dropping it. (`src/components/ModelPicker.tsx`, `src/commands/model/model.tsx`)

- **Switching model or provider mid-session no longer 400s with "Invalid `signature` in `thinking` block"**: Thinking-block signatures are bound to the model that produced them, so replaying history written by the previous model made the next request fail outright. `/model` and `/providers` now strip signature-bearing blocks from history on a model change, the same way `/login` already did on a credential change — via the existing `stripSignatureBlocks()`, whose own docstring in `query.ts` already noted signatures are model-bound. (`src/commands/model/model.tsx`, `src/commands/provider-select/provider-select.ts`)

## [0.6.4] - 2026-07-17

- **Removed local Graphify and codegraph integrations**: Deleted generated graph artifacts, local Graphify skill copies, automatic graph updates, the structure-map script, and the codegraph MCP configuration. (`src/tools/{FileEditTool,FileWriteTool}/`, `AGENT.md`, `.mcp.json`, `package.json`)

- **Standardized runtime identity as Clew Code**: Non-interactive sessions and built-in agents no longer identify Clew Code as a generic Claude agent or Anthropic's official CLI. (`src/constants/system.ts`, `src/tools/AgentTool/built-in/`)

- **Fixed `peer_spawn` startup and session inheritance**: Spawn results no longer print an undefined port, detached PowerShell cleans up startup files only after exit, and peers always inherit the user's exact provider and model without accepting a separate model override. (`src/tools/PeerSpawnTool/PeerSpawnTool.ts`)

### Added
- **`ScheduleFollowup` tool — the agent can park unfinished work and resume it later**: A new self-directed scheduling tool. The agent passes a one-line `summary` of what it was doing, the concrete `remaining` steps, and a `delayMinutes` (1 min … 7 days); the tool composes those notes into a resume prompt and enqueues it as a one-shot cron via the existing `cronScheduler`/`cronTasks` machinery, so the agent gets its own context back and continues after the delay. Session-only by default; `durable: true` persists to `.clew/scheduled_tasks.json` and surfaces missed follow-ups for catch-up on next launch. Gated by `isKairosCronEnabled()`, same as `CronCreate`; cancel with `CronDelete`. UX: the tool-use line previews `+30m · <summary>`, the result confirms `Follow-up <id> (in 30m · at 14:32) · session-only`, and — via a new optional `CronTask.label` field — the wakeup banner reads `Resuming: <summary> (Jul 17 2:32pm)` instead of the generic "Running scheduled task", so it's clear the agent is picking up its own parked work. (`src/tools/ScheduleFollowupTool/`, `src/tools.ts`, `src/utils/cronTasks.ts`, `src/hooks/useScheduledTasks.ts`, `AGENT.md`)
- **Scratchpad writes get a condensed message, and in-flight tools get an aggregated spinner verb**: (1) Writes/edits into the per-session scratchpad now render as a single line — `Made 1 scratchpad edit +N` (N = lines added) — instead of the full `Wrote N lines to <long temp path>` block with a content preview; non-scratchpad writes are unchanged. (2) While tool calls are in flight the spinner composes a verb describing them, e.g. `Making 1 scratchpad edit +25, running 3 shell commands…`, aggregating scratchpad Write/Edit calls (with added-line count) and Bash/PowerShell calls; it falls back to the default verb when no active tool warrants a custom one, and the compaction message still takes precedence. (`src/tools/FileWriteTool/UI.tsx`, `src/utils/permissions/filesystem.ts`, `src/utils/activeToolSpinnerVerb.ts`, `src/utils/activeToolSpinnerVerb.test.ts`, `src/screens/REPL.tsx`)
- **Agent tool can inherit the active session model explicitly**: `model: "inherit"` now uses the current provider and exact parent model, bypassing agent model frontmatter and the global subagent model override. ChatGPT subagents also omit unsupported `temperature` from Responses API requests. (`src/tools/AgentTool/AgentTool.tsx`, `src/utils/model/agent.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/ChatGPTProvider.ts`)
- **OpenAI provider enhancements (5 new features)**: (1) **Rate limits tracking** — extract `x-ratelimit-*` headers from OpenAI responses and expose remaining quota and reset times for display in statusline; (2) **Retry-After awareness** — parse `Retry-After` headers on 429 responses and respect their reset times instead of using fixed exponential backoff, preventing unnecessary waits and retry storms; (3) **Streaming chunk validation** — log invalid JSON chunks via optional callback (`onStreamingWarning`) for telemetry and debugging instead of silently skipping them; (4) **Strict parameter validation for tool use** — add `strict: true` to function tool definitions so OpenAI enforces argument matching against the schema, preventing hallucinated parameters; (5) **Structured outputs support** — add `response_format` to `ProviderInitOptions` to allow callers to request JSON schema validation via the `json_schema` response format (e.g. for guaranteed JSON output). (`src/services/ai/rateLimits.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/toolValidation.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/OpenAICompatibleProvider.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/ProviderInterface.ts`)

### Changed
- **`/research` web search unified onto `src/services/search`**: `ResearchTool/searchProviders.ts` carried a second, independent copy of the whole search stack (its own Tavily/Brave/Jina/DuckDuckGo transports, priority list, and key lookup) — and it was entirely dead, silently. It is now a thin adapter (478 → 83 lines) over the shared providers, so research inherits their auth, timeout, abort, 429-retry, and fallback behavior. Behavior changes worth noting: (1) providers are now tried **in sequence, first success wins** — the old code claimed "priority order" in its comments but actually ran `Promise.all` across every configured provider on every query, burning credits at each one; (2) research still appends DuckDuckGo as a last resort, while WebSearch continues to exclude it by design (`searchWithFallback`'s new `providers` option). `SearchResponse` gained `answer` (Tavily's generated summary) and a `jina` provider was ported over so nothing was lost in the move. Dead re-exports (`searchTavily`, `searchBrave`, `getAvailableSearchProviders`, and the per-provider response types) had no consumers and were removed. (`src/tools/ResearchTool/searchProviders.ts`, `src/tools/ResearchTool/index.ts`, `src/services/search/providers/jina.ts`, `src/services/search/index.ts`, `src/services/search/types.ts`)

### Fixed
- **`/compact` UX polish and grammar (4 fixes)**: (1) the post-compact line reported `1 memories extracted` — now singular-aware (`1 memory extracted` / `2 memories extracted`); (2) `Summarized 1 messages` in the "summarize from here" card had the same bug — now `Summarized 1 message`; (3) in `--verbose` with nothing extracted, `buildDisplayText` emitted `Compacted ` with a dangling trailing space — now just `Compacted`; (4) the compaction spinner read `Compacting conversation` while the surrounding hook phases used an ellipsis (`Running PreCompact hooks…`) — now `Compacting conversation…` for a consistent in-progress style. A shared `pluralize(count, word, plural?)` helper was extracted to `src/utils/format.ts` (previously a private copy in `activeToolSpinnerVerb.ts`, now deduped) with unit tests. (`src/commands/compact/compact.ts`, `src/components/CompactSummary.tsx`, `src/screens/REPL.tsx`, `src/utils/format.ts`, `src/utils/format.test.ts`, `src/utils/activeToolSpinnerVerb.ts`)
- **Context-usage warning was always red — the yellow "approaching" band was dead code**: `WARNING_THRESHOLD_BUFFER_TOKENS` and `ERROR_THRESHOLD_BUFFER_TOKENS` were both `20_000`, so `calculateTokenWarningState` computed identical warning and error thresholds. Since `TokenWarning` only renders once `isAboveWarningThreshold` is true — at which point `isAboveErrorThreshold` was necessarily true too — the `isAboveErrorThreshold ? 'red' : 'yellow'` choice never picked yellow, and the two-band design collapsed into a single red state. Lowered the error buffer to `10_000` so red now escalates only in the last 10K tokens before the auto-compact threshold, restoring the yellow→red progression. Only affects the warning's color (the error threshold has no other consumer). (`src/services/compact/autoCompact.ts`, `src/services/compact/autoCompact.test.ts`)
- **`/research` returned zero web sources on every run, silently (4 fixes)**: (1) **`ofetch` called with 3 arguments** — `ofetch(url, payload, opts)` is not its signature (`ofetch(request, options)`); the payload was parsed as options, so `searchTavily()` issued a bodyless **GET** whose `query` string was spread into per-character params (`/search?0=t&1=e&2=s&3=t`) and came back `401 Unauthorized`; (2) **`response.data` does not exist** — ofetch returns the parsed body directly, so both `searchTavily()` and `searchBrave()` read `undefined` and Brave threw on `data.web` even when its request succeeded; (3) every failure was swallowed by `catch → logError → return null`, so `collectWebSearch()` just wrote a report with no web sources and no error; (4) **API keys were read from `process.env` only**, ignoring the `settings.env` fallback that `README` documents and the rest of the codebase honors. Verified against the live API: `searchWithProviders()` went from 0 sources to 5 results with excerpts, scores, and Tavily's `answer` intact. (`src/tools/ResearchTool/searchProviders.ts`, `src/tools/ResearchTool/searchProviders.test.ts`)
- **WebSearch failed with `tavily search timed out after 5s` on nearly every query (5 fixes)**: (1) **Timeout far too short** — the shared provider timeout was 5s, but Tavily's own documentation uses a 20s client timeout for the default `search_depth` and offers a separate `ultra-fast` depth for latency-sensitive callers; a measured live query took 14.6s, so the ceiling cut off healthy responses mid-flight. Raised to 20s; (2) **Timeout never cancelled the request** — the timeout was a `Promise.race` against a bare `setTimeout` with no `AbortSignal`, so the losing `fetch` kept running and holding its socket. Provider `search()` now takes a `signal` (plumbed into every `fetch`) and the caller's abort signal is forwarded, with a caller-initiated cancel distinguished from a timeout; (3) **One slow provider sank the whole search** — `selectBestDirectProvider()` picked a single provider by priority and `WebSearchTool` searched only that one, so a Tavily timeout failed the tool even with Brave/Serper configured. Replaced with `searchWithFallback()`, which walks every configured provider in order (also advancing past a provider that returns zero results) and reports each failure if all of them fail; (4) **429 responses were not retried** — Tavily returns a `retry-after` header on rate limit, which was discarded and surfaced as a generic error; 429 now raises `SearchRateLimitError` and is retried up to twice honoring `retry-after` (reusing `parseRetryAfter()` from `src/services/ai/rateLimits.ts`, capped at 10s); (5) **Deprecated Tavily auth** — the API key was sent as an `api_key` body field instead of the documented `Authorization: Bearer` header. A missing `results` array in a Tavily response also no longer throws. (`src/services/search/index.ts`, `src/services/search/errors.ts`, `src/services/search/types.ts`, `src/services/search/providers/`, `src/services/search/search.test.ts`, `src/tools/WebSearchTool/WebSearchTool.ts`)
- **`/reload-plugins` now discovers plugins added during the current session**: Explicit plugin refreshes invalidate the installed-plugin snapshot before rebuilding commands, agents, hooks, MCP, and LSP registrations. (`src/utils/plugins/refresh.ts`)
- **Peer spawn system hardening (7 fixes)**: (1) **Misleading port/joined fields** — removed hardcoded `port: 0` and `joined: false` that were never updated, leading to false status info; (2) **Linux terminal fallback silent failure** — if `x-terminal-emulator` failed, `gnome-terminal` fallback had no error handling; now tries xterm as final fallback and reports meaningful errors; (3) **Temp file cleanup missing** — Windows `.ps1` and prompt files accumulated in `tmpdir()`; now cleaned up asynchronously after spawn; (4) **Credential leaks to spawned peers** — child inherited parent's `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, SSH keys, and user info; filtered sensitive env vars; (5) **Missing main script validation** — if `process.argv[1]` was undefined on Windows, would create invalid PowerShell scripts; now validates before build; (6) **Process spawn not tracked** — detached peer process never verified; moved validation checks before `detach` so errors are caught early; (7) **No error reporting on spawn failure** — silent failures on Linux; now all branches report errors. (`src/tools/PeerSpawnTool/PeerSpawnTool.ts`)
- **API provider bug sweep (7 fixes across OpenAI-compatible and Gemini layers)**: (1) String token counts dropped to 0 — `normalizeUsage()` used a double-escaped regex (`/^\\d+$/`); (2) Image stripping discarded tool results — when removing images from text-only provider messages, content was rebuilt from text parts only; (3) Double-billing after JSON parse failure — 2xx responses with unparseable bodies were retried up to 3 times; (4) **OpenRouter/KiloCode headers lost** — both overrode `getExtraHeaders()` without merging constructor-supplied headers; (5) Hyphenated provider IDs produced unsettable env vars (`KILO-CODE_BASE_URL` instead of `KILO_CODE_BASE_URL`); (6) **Gemini: millisecond/minute confusion** — "reset after 500ms" parsed as 500 minutes due to regex alternation order (`m` before `ms`); (7) **Gemini: duplicate tool call IDs** — two calls to the same tool in one turn collided (ID was bare function name); (8) **Gemini: images silently dropped** — images sent to Gemini were discarded because `messageText()` extracted only text parts. (`src/services/ai/usageNormalizer.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/OpenAICompatibleProvider.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/OpenRouterProvider.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/KiloCodeProvider.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/CodeAssistProvider.ts`)

### Removed
- **Clew Gateway provider** (`clew-gateway`): Removed the non-functional gateway provider. The provider never correctly read its `CLEW_GATEWAY_URL` env var (used `CLEW_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` instead), suffered from tool ID collisions in streaming mode, and silently dropped image content. Gateway-backed deployments should use a custom OpenAI-compatible provider entry or `/workspace link` instead. (`src/services/ai/providers/ClewGatewayProvider.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/ClewGatewayProvider.test.ts`, `src/services/ai/providerRegistry.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/ProviderInterface.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers.json`, `src/cli/handlers/auth.ts`)
- **Application profiles**: Removed the obsolete `personal`/`coding` profile setting, personal system prompt, persona footer, profile indicator, profile-aware logo variants, and personal-only `/delegate` skill. Legacy settings have their `profile` field stripped during loading. First-run onboarding now renders `WelcomeV2`; the regular REPL continues to use the standard `LogoV2`. Private `MemoryScope = 'personal' | 'team'` behavior is unchanged. (`src/components/Onboarding.tsx`, `src/components/LogoV2/`, `src/components/PromptInput/`, `src/components/Messages.tsx`, `src/state/AppStateStore.ts`, `src/constants/profilePrompts.ts`, `src/utils/settings/`)

### Added
- **Warning when the connection drops mid-response**: A stream that emitted content and then ended without any terminal `stop_reason` was treated as a completed response — the user was left with a silently truncated answer. Such a stream now yields `API Error: Connection closed mid-response. The response above may be incomplete.` (rendered with the standard API-error chrome). Deliberately a warning rather than a throw: the existing produced-nothing check falls back to a non-streaming retry, but here a partial answer is already on screen and retrying would discard it and double-bill. (`src/services/api/claude.ts`)

### Removed
- **ExecAgent local subprocess delegation**: Removed the `ExecAgent` tool, its Codex/OpenCode/Claude Code process providers, PTY renderer, progress type, tests, and `/peer run` command. Personal-profile delegation now uses LAN peer workers through `/delegate` only. The unrelated `execAgentHook` remains: despite the similar name, it implements settings-based `type: "agent"` hooks and never depended on ExecAgent. (`src/tools.ts`, `src/tools/ProcessDelegateTool/`, `src/tools/processDelegateTerminal.tsx`, `src/peer/ProcessDelegateProvider.ts`, `src/commands/peer/peer.tsx`, `src/types/tools.ts`, `src/Tool.ts`, `src/constants/profilePrompts.ts`, `src/skills/bundled/personalDelegate.ts`)

### Fixed
- **Provider selection reverted to a stale provider on every new session**: `saveSelectedProviderConfig()` reverts `provider` to the on-disk value while a session override is active (so one terminal's switch can't leak into the shared `provider.json`), but it did not revert `providerConfig` alongside it. Any persisting write — e.g. `/model <model>` with persist-as-default — therefore leaked the session's `providerConfig` to disk while rolling `provider` back, leaving `provider.json` self-contradictory (`provider: "opencode"` next to a `chatgpt` `providerConfig`). `getActiveProviderName()` reads `provider`, so every new session resolved the stale provider forever. `providerConfig` is now reverted together with `provider`, keeping the file internally consistent. Note this is distinct from `/providers set` being session-scoped by design — use `--global`/`-g` to persist a provider choice. (`src/services/ai/ProviderManager.ts`, `src/services/ai/ProviderManager.providerConfigConsistency.test.ts`)
- **`RENDER ERROR: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'message.message.content')` crashed the whole REPL**: `isNotEmptyMessage()` short-circuited only `progress`/`attachment`/`system` and then read `message.message.content` on everything else — but `system_api_error`, `system_file_snapshot`, `system_local_command` and `stream_event` carry no `.message` envelope, and `normalizeMessages()`'s `default` branch passes them straight through. `Messages.tsx` runs `normalizeMessages(messages).filter(isNotEmptyMessage)` during render, so a single such message took down the entire message list via the error boundary. Envelope presence is now checked structurally (`if (!message.message) return true`) rather than by listing types — the type whitelist is what went stale as new envelope-less types were added. Note this class of bug is invisible to `tsc` because `types/message.ts` declares `Message` with an `[key: string]: unknown` index signature. (`src/utils/messages.ts`, `src/utils/messages.isNotEmptyMessage.test.ts`)
- **`RENDER ERROR: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'message.uuid.slice')` no longer takes down the REPL**: malformed or legacy transcript entries without a non-empty `uuid` could pass normalization and visibility filtering, then crash unseen-divider matching when `Messages` sliced every rendered UUID. The renderer now rejects UUID-less entries at its input boundary while preserving valid envelope-less system events. (`src/components/Messages.tsx`, `src/utils/messages.ts`, `src/utils/messages.isNotEmptyMessage.test.ts`)

### Added
- **Codex rate limits exposed to statusline scripts**: `StatusLineCommandInput` gained `codex_rate_limits` (same `five_hour`/`seven_day` shape as the existing Anthropic `rate_limits`), so a custom statusline can show ChatGPT/Codex subscription usage alongside Anthropic's. Data comes from the passive snapshot captured off live `/responses` traffic — the new `getCodexUtilization()` reads it synchronously and never probes, so the statusline hot path stays cheap; the field is absent until the `chatgpt` provider has been used in the session. (`src/components/StatusLine.tsx`, `src/types/statusLine.ts`, `src/services/api/codexUsage.ts`)

### Changed
- **StatusLine right side removed entirely**: Usage percentage, context bar, context size (`1.0M`), and MCPs count all removed from the built-in status line — right side is now empty (only `rightText` remains). Cleaned up unused functions and imports. (`src/components/StatusLine.tsx`)
- **Architecture diagrams in AGENT.md and README.md updated**: Replaced flat file listings with layered ASCII architecture diagrams showing the full data flow — entry → REPL/TUI → commands/query engine → providers → tools/services/tasks, plus the agent execution hierarchy. (`AGENT.md`, `README.md`)
- **`/reload-plugins` shows a persistent summary instead of `(no content)`**: The command rendered a fancy `⚡ ENVIRONMENT REFRESH COMPLETE ⚡` dashboard but called `onDone()` with no result string — so the dashboard flashed for a single frame and the persisted output was empty. The transient dashboard (and its spinner) is removed — the command renders nothing while reloading and a one-line summary — `Reloaded: N plugins · N skills · N agents · N hooks · N plugin MCP servers · N plugin LSP servers` (with a trailing error count + `/doctor` hint when loads fail) — is persisted as the result, mirroring upstream Claude Code's format. (`src/commands/reload-plugins/reload-plugins.ts`)
- **`peer_spawn` inherits the spawner's provider and bypasses permissions**: Spawned peers inherit the active provider through `AI_PROVIDER`, use the current session's exact model, and launch with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` so they can work autonomously without permission prompts. (`src/tools/PeerSpawnTool/PeerSpawnTool.ts`)

### Added
- **Claude OAuth `/usage` falls back to live rate-limit headers when the usage endpoint is rate-limited**: If `/api/oauth/usage` returns 429 and no fresh cached response is available, `/usage` now maps the latest Anthropic rate-limit header snapshot (`claudeAiLimits.getRawUtilization()`) into the same bars, so subscription users still see session/weekly usage like Codex after normal Claude traffic. The usage endpoint is cached briefly and its `retry-after` is honored to avoid self-inflicted 429 loops. (`src/services/api/usage.ts`, `src/services/api/usage.test.ts`)
- **`/usage` now shows Codex (ChatGPT subscription) usage and is always selectable**: Previously `/usage` was gated to `claude-ai` subscribers only (hidden for everyone else) and hit Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint. It is now (1) provider-aware — when the active session provider is `chatgpt`, it renders that plan's Codex windows (primary → "Current session (5h)", secondary → "Current week"); and (2) no longer hidden — the command is available on every provider, showing usage bars where quota data exists (Claude AI, Codex) and a clear "Usage limits aren't available for the &lt;provider&gt; provider." message otherwise (e.g. OpenAI-compatible gateways like OpenCode), instead of the command silently disappearing. Since the Codex OAuth backend exposes no usage endpoint, limits are captured off live `/responses` traffic — the reply carries `x-codex-primary-*` / `x-codex-secondary-*` rate-limit headers (`used-percent`, `reset-after-seconds`, `window-minutes`) — into a new `src/services/codexLimits.ts` snapshot, mirroring how `claudeAiLimits.ts` reads Anthropic headers. Windows are classified by `window-minutes` (≤6h → session, longer → weekly) rather than by header order, and all-zero/inactive windows are dropped (a "plus" plan may expose only the weekly window). A best-effort probe populates `/usage` on first open; because Codex rejects non-streaming `/responses` ("Stream must be set to true"), the probe streams and cancels the body immediately after reading the headers, so it costs a request but not a full generation. Codex field parsing is deliberately defensive and degrades gracefully rather than erroring. (`src/services/codexLimits.ts`, `src/services/api/codexUsage.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/ChatGPTProvider.ts`, `src/components/Settings/Usage.tsx`, `src/commands/usage/index.ts`, `src/types/command.ts`, `src/commands.ts`)
- **Automatic recap toggle in `/config`**: Added an "Automatic recap" boolean setting to the `/config` UI that flips `recapEnabled`, so users can disable the automatic away/long-turn recaps without editing config files or the `CLEW_CODE_ENABLE_AWAY_SUMMARY` env var. (`src/components/Settings/Config.tsx`)
- **`/statusline` command**: Set up or update the terminal status line from chat, modeled after Claude Code's `/statusline`. Dispatches the built-in `statusline-setup` agent, which imports an existing shell PS1 config (or asks what to show — directory, git branch, model, context %, rate-limit usage) and writes the `statusLine` command into settings. Accepts an optional argument describing what to show (e.g. `/statusline directory and git branch`). (`src/commands/statusline/`, `src/commands.ts`)
- **`/usage` Web API fallback via `sessionKey` cookie + `/usage-cookie` command**: When the OAuth usage endpoint returns empty or errors with 401, `/usage` now falls back to the Claude.ai Web API using a `sessionKey` cookie. Use `/usage-cookie &lt;sessionKey&gt;` to store the key in secure storage (one-time setup, persists across sessions) — or set `CLEW_CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY` env var. The fallback fetches organizations, usage windows (`five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_sonnet`), and overage spend limits from `claude.ai/api/*`, mapping them to the same `Utilization` type. Falls back gracefully with a hint pointing to `/usage-cookie`. Missing `SecureStorage` types also added. (`src/services/api/usage.ts`, `src/components/Settings/Usage.tsx`, `src/services/api/usage.test.ts`, `src/utils/secureStorage/types.ts`, `src/commands/usage-cookie/`)

### Removed
- **`google-assist` provider from `/providers`**: The Gemini Code Assist (OAuth) entry was removed from `providers.json` — it no longer appears in the `/providers` picker. The provider class, `/login` flow, and OAuth token import remain in the codebase for anyone who wants to re-enable it locally. (`src/services/ai/providers.json`)

### Fixed
- **CI coverage is enforced again**: Removed the temporary `continue-on-error` escape hatch after confirming the full Bun coverage run passes, and cleaned up stale Biome suppressions so `check:ci` reports a clean source tree. (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `biome.json`, `src/`)
- **API errors from third-party providers now surface instead of hanging silently**: `withRetry` only yielded the user-visible "API error · retrying" status line when the error was an Anthropic `APIError` instance (`error instanceof APIError`). Third-party providers (OpenAI-compatible gateways like OpenCode) throw a plain `Error` carrying a `_providerError` marker (`AnthropicAdapter.normalizeError`), so every provider-side 429/5xx retry was swallowed — the user saw only a spinner while the request looped in the background (up to 11 attempts) with no indication anything was wrong. A new `isSurfaceableRetryError()` guard now also matches provider errors (via `getProviderErrorInfo`), `createSystemAPIErrorMessage` accepts a plain `Error`, and the retry-status renderer's noise threshold dropped from `retryAttempt < 4` (~20s of silence) to `< 2` so sustained errors show by the second attempt. (`src/services/api/withRetry.ts`, `src/utils/messages.ts`, `src/components/messages/SystemAPIErrorMessage.tsx`)
- **API keys no longer written in plaintext to debug logs**: The `[Query] Active provider` debug line `JSON.stringify(providerConfig)`'d the whole provider config, which embeds `apiKeys` (and could embed auth tokens) — so every request logged live API keys to `~/.clew/debug/*.txt`, files that routinely get pasted into bug reports. A new `stringifyWithRedactedSecrets()` util redacts secret-bearing fields (`apiKeys`, `token`, `authorization`, `secret`, …) at any depth while preserving structure (provider names stay visible for debugging). (`src/utils/redactSecrets.ts`, `src/services/api/claude.ts`)
- **`/providers` custom-provider switch no longer leaks into other terminals**: Selecting a custom provider/model in the interactive picker (session-only) wrote the new `provider` + `model` + `baseUrl` to the shared `provider.json`, so other running terminals picked up the switch on their next turn. Session-only selections now keep the provider/model/`baseUrl` in a process-local session overlay on `ProviderManager` (`setSessionProviderConfig`, overlaid by `getSelectedProviderConfig`; raw disk reads use the new `getOnDiskProviderConfig`) and persist only the API key to disk. Built-in providers were already safe; this closes the custom-endpoint path. (`src/services/ai/ProviderManager.ts`, `src/commands/provider-select/provider-select.ts`, `src/state/onChangeAppState.ts`)
- **`!` bash mode no longer silently dead — fixed a shadowed JSX factory**: Typing `!<cmd>` produced no output at all. `processBashCommand` declared a local `let jsx` variable, which shadowed the automatic JSX-runtime factory injected by the `react-jsx` transform (`jsxImportSource: "react"`). Every `<Component/>` in that scope compiled to a call on the still-undefined local instead of the runtime, so rendering `BashModeProgress` threw `'D' is undefined` and the command crashed before it ever ran. The local is renamed to `capturedJsx` (with a comment warning against the `jsx` name). Reproduced on a clean HEAD build via `bun dist/main.js -p '!echo hello'`. (`src/utils/processUserInput/processBashCommand.tsx`)
- **Prompt-suggestion ghost text no longer discarded before it can appear**: `executePromptSuggestion` fires from the turn-end stop hook (`stopHooks.ts`), where `isLoading` is often still `true`, so the derived `promptSuggestion` value is transiently `null`. The "timing suppression" block in `PromptInput.tsx` deleted the freshly generated suggestion on that first render — before `isLoading` flipped to `false` — so the faint next-message ghost text never showed on an empty prompt. The block now also guards on `!isLoading`, so it only discards a suggestion once idle (where a `null` derived value genuinely means the user has started typing / it's stale), not during the loading tail. (`src/components/PromptInput/PromptInput.tsx`)
- **`PERSONAL_PROFILE_PROMPT` no longer references the renamed `delegate` tool**: The personal profile prompt told the AI to "use the `delegate` tool" — but the tool was renamed to `ExecAgent` in `3cc98702` to avoid collision with the LAN peer system. The prompt now correctly points to the `/delegate` skill (for LAN peer delegation) and the `ExecAgent` tool (for local Codex subprocess). (`src/constants/profilePrompts.ts`)
- **README.md and CLAUDE.md stale references fixed**: `AGENTS.md` → `AGENT.md` (3 links in README), "29 providers" → "32 providers" (README), `npx vitest run` → `bun test` (README + CLAUDE), and "# Tests (via Vitest)" → "# Tests (via Bun)" (CLAUDE.md). (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
- **`/recap` no longer prints `undefined` or dead-ends when the summary model fails**: The recap dashboard depended entirely on an LLM call (`generateAwaySummary` → small/fast model). When that call returned `null` — common on third-party/free providers whose small-fast model id isn't usable — the command showed a "Could not generate a recap right now" error pane, and exiting it handed `undefined` back to the transcript, which rendered literally as `undefined`. Now the dashboard is **local-first**: it always renders session metrics + recent intents + a locally-computed summary, treats the AI synthesis as a best-effort enhancement (shown when available, with an "AI synthesis unavailable" note otherwise), and always hands back a non-empty string on exit. `generateAwaySummary` also now falls back from the small/fast model to the main-loop model on API error before giving up, so the automatic long-turn/away recaps stop failing silently too. The long-turn recap in `REPL.tsx` now runs on its own `AbortController` instead of reusing the finished turn's signal. (`src/commands/recap/recap.tsx`, `src/services/awaySummary.ts`, `src/screens/REPL.tsx`)
- **`/statusline` setup defaults to a cross-platform Node script instead of `jq`**: The built-in `statusline-setup` agent prompt told the agent to parse the status JSON with `jq` (absent on most Windows machines) and referenced `~/.claude`. It now defaults to a standalone Node script that reads the JSON from stdin (no `jq`, no bash/Node escaping pitfalls), references `~/.clew`, warns against embedding backslash regexes in bash-quoted `node -e` strings, and the agent gained the `Write` tool so it can actually create the script file. (`src/tools/AgentTool/built-in/statuslineSetup.ts`)
- **Session model/provider no longer leaks across in-process sessions**: `/model` and `/providers set` previously called `ProviderManager.setSessionModel()` / `setSessionProvider()` (`ProviderManager` is a process-global singleton), so the override was inherited by every other in-process session (spawned agents, `/bg` tasks). Now session-scoped model/provider changes flow through AppState's `mainLoopModelForSession` / `mainLoopProviderForSession`, which `onChangeAppState` syncs to `mainLoopModelOverride` (for `getUserSpecifiedModelSetting`) and `ProviderManager.sessionProvider` (for `getActiveProviderName`). `getModelForProvider()` no longer reads `this.sessionModel`, preventing the singleton from overriding the correct on-disk config model for unrelated sessions. (`src/commands/model/model.tsx`, `src/commands/provider-select/provider-select.ts`, `src/services/ai/ProviderManager.ts`, `src/state/onChangeAppState.ts`, `src/services/ai/ProviderManager.test.ts`)
- **Error handling in `/reload-plugins` and plugin refresh**: The catch block now uses `toError()` + error ID (`E_RELOAD_PLUGINS_FAILED`) for safe error extraction and Sentry tracking. MCP/LSP per-plugin failures no longer short-circuit `Promise.all` — each plugin's loading is wrapped in an individual try-catch, logging the error and continuing. Error IDs added for plugin hook and MCP/LSP load failures. (`src/commands/reload-plugins/reload-plugins.ts`, `src/utils/plugins/refresh.ts`, `src/constants/errorIds.ts`)
- **Removed dead `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` dependency**: The package had zero imports in `src/` and was a leftover from the MCP SDK rename. (`package.json`)
- **CI hardened: coverage gate, clean dependency audit, restored compaction modules**: The Coverage job is now a real gate again (the temporary `continue-on-error` was removed after the full Bun coverage run passed). `bun audit` is clean (`No vulnerabilities found`) via pinning vulnerable transitive deps in `package.json` `overrides` (`@grpc/grpc-js`, `protobufjs`, `fast-uri`, `hono`, `ip-address`, `qs`, `shell-quote`, `uuid`, `ws`, `@protobufjs/utf8`). The deleted `src/services/compact/snipCompact.js` / `snipProjection.js` modules were restored as `.ts` (consumed by `QueryEngine.ts` and `src/utils/messages.ts`) so they no longer resolve to undefined at runtime or under `tsc`, and all message interfaces in `src/types/message.ts` now extend the base `Message` (`{ type: string; [key: string]: unknown }`) to satisfy predicate/array covariance. Blocking CI jobs (shadow-pair guard, `bun ci` lockfile, `bun test`, `bun run build`, Coverage) all pass. (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `package.json`, `biome.json`, `src/services/compact/snipCompact.ts`, `src/services/compact/snipProjection.ts`, `src/types/message.ts`, `src/QueryEngine.ts`)
- **TypeScript: cleared 14 missing-import (`TS2304`) errors across 9 files**: Added the missing symbol imports so `tsc` no longer reports them as undefined — `DOT_CLEW` (`src/utils/clewPaths.js`) in `src/agentRuntime/toolGateway.ts`; `jsonParse` in `src/commands/branch/branch.ts`; `join` (`node:path`) in `src/commands/memory/memory.tsx`; `isCancelError` in `src/components/Feedback.tsx`; `Ansi` (`src/ink/Ansi.js`) in `src/components/PromptInput/PromptInput.tsx`; `errorMessage` in `src/services/SessionMemory/consolidation.ts`; `logError` in `src/services/SessionMemory/sessionMemory.ts`; `ContentBlockParam` in `src/Tool.ts`; `logForDebugging` in `src/utils/computerUse/hostAdapter.ts`. Total `tsc` errors drop from 3084 to 3070. (`src/agentRuntime/toolGateway.ts`, `src/commands/branch/branch.ts`, `src/commands/memory/memory.tsx`, `src/components/Feedback.tsx`, `src/components/PromptInput/PromptInput.tsx`, `src/services/SessionMemory/consolidation.ts`, `src/services/SessionMemory/sessionMemory.ts`, `src/Tool.ts`, `src/utils/computerUse/hostAdapter.ts`)
- **Cleared `isFetchError` "cannot find name" errors across 13 modules and trimmed `tsc` type debt**: `isFetchError` (exported from `src/utils/errors.ts`) was called without an import in 16 sites across 13 files (`src/bridge/remoteBridgeCore.ts`, `src/components/Feedback.tsx`, `src/services/api/bootstrap.ts`, `src/services/mcp/auth.ts`, `src/services/oauth/client.ts`, `src/services/teamMemorySync/index.ts`, `src/utils/background/remote/preconditions.ts`, `src/utils/errorLogSink.ts`, `src/utils/ide.ts`, `src/utils/plugins/marketplaceManager.ts`, `src/utils/plugins/officialMarketplaceGcs.ts`, `src/utils/teleport.tsx`, `src/utils/teleport/api.ts`) — each now imports it from `src/utils/errors.js`. Also added `@types/lodash-es` (resolves `TS7016` for `lodash-es/*` deep imports) and declared `var BUDDY: unknown` in `src/global.d.ts` (resolves the `BUDDY` global). `tsc` error count fell from 4185 to 3084. (`src/utils/errors.ts`, `src/global.d.ts`, `package.json`)
- **Note — TypeScript check is intentionally non-blocking**: `bun x tsc --noEmit` still reports a large pre-existing type-debt count (the bulk is outside this change set and predates it). The `typecheck` CI job remains `continue-on-error: true` so the pipeline's blocking jobs — not the unresolved type debt — determine green. Bringing `tsc` to zero is tracked separately as a codebase-wide type-hardening effort, not a CI-repair blocker.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- **`/checkup` command**: System diagnostic command that scans unused skills, MCP servers, plugins, and health — modeled after Claude Code's `/checkup`. Reports enabled/disabled status per category, flags empty skill directories, detects inherited `.mcp.json` configs from parent directories. Run `/checkup` for a full report. (`src/commands/checkup/`, `src/commands.ts`)
- **In-app Google login for the `google-assist` provider**: Selecting **Gemini Code Assist (OAuth)** in `/providers` (or running `/login` with google-assist active) now runs a browser OAuth flow using the Gemini CLI's public client + cloud-platform scopes, writing tokens to `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (shared with the Gemini CLI) — no more "install the Gemini CLI first" requirement. When creds already exist the picker offers use-existing / sign-in-again. Supports both automatic loopback callback and headless paste-code mode. Note: Google's Device Authorization Flow can't be used here — it doesn't allow the cloud-platform scope. (`src/commands/provider-select/provider-select.ts`, `src/commands/login/login.tsx`, `src/components/GoogleOAuthFlow.tsx`, `src/services/googleOAuth/index.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers/CodeAssistProvider.ts`)
- **Running-agent footer badge**: The prompt footer now shows a compact `← N agent(s)` badge (after the `esc to interrupt` hint) whenever background `local_agent` tasks are running, mirroring the Claude Code affordance. When every background task is a local agent, the badge replaces the verbose `N local agents` pill while keeping the `↓ to manage` hint; mixed task sets still show the combined pill. (`src/components/PromptInput/PromptInputFooterLeftSide.tsx`)
- **Skip retries on insufficient balance errors**: API errors indicating insufficient balance, quota, or funds (e.g., `insufficient_quota`, `out of balance`, `no credits`) are now classified as non-retryable. Avoids wasting time retrying when the account has no funds. New error category `insufficient_balance` in `ProviderErrorInfo`. (`src/services/api/errors.ts`, `src/services/api/withRetry.ts`)
- **Agent room script**: Multi-agent free-talk room so Claude Code, OpenCode, Clew Code, and Codex can converse with a shared transcript (`round-robin` / `free` / `parallel` modes, dry-run, interactive human inject). Run via `bun run agent-room "<topic>"`. (`scripts/agent-room.ts`, `package.json`)
- **Exec agent CLI args**: OpenCode and Claude Code process-delegate providers now use proper one-shot flags (`opencode run`, `claude -p`) instead of bare stdin. (`src/peer/ProcessDelegateProvider.ts`)
- **OpenGateway provider**: Added `opengateway` provider (OpenAI-compatible gateway at `opengateway.gitlawb.com`) with 10 models — smart routing (`auto`), MiMo V2.5 Pro / V2.5, MiniMax M3, Qwen 3.7 Max, GLM 5.2, Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite, Tencent HY3 (free), and Nemotron 3 Ultra (free). Uses `OPENGATEWAY_API_KEY` env var. (`src/services/ai/providers.json`, `src/services/ai/providers/ProviderInterface.ts`, `src/services/ai/providerRegistry.ts`, `src/utils/model/validateModel.ts`, `src/utils/stats.ts`)

### Changed
- **Copy-to-clipboard toast moves to the top-right of the prompt in fullscreen**: The "copied N chars to clipboard" toast now renders in the top notification band (right-aligned, above the prompt border) in fullscreen mode instead of the bottom footer row, keeping copy feedback in the same spot as other prompt notifications. The inline (non-fullscreen) footer placement is unchanged; the footer toast is suppressed in fullscreen to avoid a duplicate. (`src/components/PromptInput/PromptInput.tsx`, `src/components/PromptInput/PromptInputFooter.tsx`)

### Fixed
- **Vision images on gateway providers no longer hard-fail on non-VLM models**: On `opengateway`/`opencode` (and other OpenAI-compatible gateways), models not statically listed in `providers.json` fall back to the provider-level `imageIn: true`, so an attached image was sent to text-only models like `tencent/hy3`, which reply `400 The model is not a VLM (Vision Language Model)`. That wire message wasn't recognized, so the whole turn errored out. Now the adapter (1) recognizes "not a VLM" / "vision language model" / "text-only" 400s as a vision-unsupported error, and (2) automatically retries the request **text-only** (stripping image parts, leaving an `[Image not sent — <model> does not support vision]` note) for both streaming and non-streaming paths, so the model still answers instead of failing. (`src/services/ai/adapter/AnthropicAdapter.ts`, `src/services/ai/adapter/AnthropicAdapter.test.ts`)
- **Google OAuth 400 error on login**: Google rejects the `localhost` hostname and non-registered callback paths with a `400. That's an error. The server cannot process the request because it is malformed.` on the consent page. The redirect URI now uses the loopback IP `127.0.0.1` with the `/oauth2callback` path, mirroring the Gemini CLI's registered public OAuth client (`http://127.0.0.1:{port}/oauth2callback`). (`src/constants/googleOAuth.ts`, `src/services/googleOAuth/index.ts`)

- **Gemini Code Assist (OAuth) provider now works end-to-end**: The `google-assist` provider (Gemini via `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`, no API key) was hidden from the picker and non-functional. Fixed: (1) token refresh required manual `CODE_ASSIST_CLIENT_ID`/`CODE_ASSIST_CLIENT_SECRET` — now defaults to the Gemini CLI's public OAuth client so login-and-go works, and reuses the on-disk access token while still valid; (2) the parser read `data.candidates` but Code Assist wraps payloads under `data.response` — responses always came back empty (now unwrapped, with `usageMetadata` mapped to OpenAI usage); (3) added full tool-calling support (OpenAI tools → Gemini `functionDeclarations`, assistant `tool_calls` → `functionCall`, tool results → `functionResponse`, and `functionCall`→`tool_calls` in both non-streaming and streaming responses). (4) schema sanitization for Gemini: stripped JSON-Schema fields (`$schema`, `additionalProperties`), whitelisted only Gemini-compatible fields, and collapsed `anyOf`/`oneOf` to force single-field unions (Gemini limitation). Updated model list to include Gemini 3.5 Flash (default, GA), Gemini 3.1 Pro (preview), Gemini 3.0 Flash (preview), and kept 2.5-series fallbacks. Enabled `toolCalling: true` and un-hid the provider from `PROVIDER_IDS`. (`src/services/ai/providers/CodeAssistProvider.ts`, `src/services/ai/providers.json`, `src/services/ai/providerRegistry.ts`)
- **WebSearch direct-search fallback**: Replaced the dead DuckDuckGo scraping fallback with a Tavily/Brave/Serper-backed search. It now throws a clear configuration error if none of these API keys are configured, rather than attempting to scrape DuckDuckGo and failing or returning empty results. (`src/tools/WebSearchTool/WebSearchTool.ts`, `src/tools/ResearchTool/searchProviders.ts`)
- **Resume now restores the full conversation, not just the last message**: A race between the two transcript recorders (`QueryEngine.recordTranscript` and the incremental `useLogMessages` effect) left the first assistant sub-message after each user/tool_result message with `parentUuid: null`, shattering a session into dozens of disconnected islands. Resume's leaf→root chain walk recovered only the final island (a 155-message session resumed as 2). Added `repairFragmentedParentChain()` in `buildResumeConversationChain()` to stitch orphaned main-thread messages to the previous chain participant in file order (sidechains and compact boundaries untouched), and routed the `/resume` slash command + `getLastSessionLog` + `--resume <id>` through `includePreCompactHistory`. (`src/utils/sessionStorage.ts`, `src/commands/resume/resume.tsx`, `src/utils/conversationRecovery.ts`)
- **Logout provider label**: Fixed the `/logout` success message to label the Google provider as `Google Gemini` (provider id is `google`, not `gemini`). (`src/commands/logout/logout.tsx`)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Context usage HUD**: TokenWarning now renders a segmented context bar with per-category breakdown (system prompt, tools, messages, tool results). Shows `N% until auto-compact` with color-coded segments. (`src/components/TokenWarning.tsx`)
- **Compact regret detection**: Tracks tool signatures dropped during compaction and flags when the model re-references them within a 3-turn window — measurement-only phase. (`src/services/compact/autoCompact.ts`, `src/query.ts`)
- **Auto-compact hard threshold**: Added `AUTOCOMPACT_HARD_BUFFER_TOKENS` (20K) for force-compaction mid-tool-chain when `CLEW_CODE_BOUNDARY_COMPACT` is enabled. Includes `isAtNaturalBoundary()` and `estimateCompressibility()` heuristics. (`src/services/compact/autoCompact.ts`)
- **Streaming retry with backoff**: Changed from single retry to configurable limit (default 3) with exponential backoff before non-streaming fallback. Controlled via `CLEW_CODE_STREAMING_RETRIES`. (`src/services/api/claude.ts`)
- **MCP url→urls normalization**: `normalizeMcpToolArgsForSchema()` converts single `url` string to `urls` array for tools whose `inputSchema` expects array type — fixes compatibility with web-scraping MCP servers. (`src/services/mcp/client.ts`)
- **Session search background indexing**: Debounced (30s) async FTS5 indexing, precompiled query statement for reuse, incremental vacuum every hour. (`src/services/sessionSearch/sessionSearchDb.ts`)
- **Search cache + codegraph integration**: Glob/Grep results cached in-memory with LRU eviction (max 500). FileEdit/FileWrite invalidate cache and schedule codegraph update on write. (`src/utils/searchCache.ts`, `src/utils/codegraphUpdate.ts`, `src/tools/{FileEditTool,FileWriteTool,GlobTool,GrepTool}/`)
- **Enterprise audit logging**: Added NDJSON audit log writer/service, env-based opt-in, tool execution audit events, command/file access audit events, rotation/filtering, and focused tests. (`src/services/auditLog/`, `src/services/tools/toolExecution.ts`)
- **README sections**: Added table of contents, prerequisites, use cases, screenshots, configuration reference, FAQ, contributing guide, and star history link. (`README.md`)
- **Terminal title utility**: Extracted shared `setTerminalTitle()` to `src/utils/terminalTitle.ts`. (`src/utils/terminalTitle.ts`)
- **Screenshot asset**: Added REPL screenshot for README. (`assets/screenshots/`)
- **Test for media fallback**: Added `AnthropicAdapter` test covering DeepSeek text-only model image stripping. (`src/services/ai/adapter/AnthropicAdapter.test.ts`)

### Changed
- **`.js` shadow cleanup complete**: Removed 401 committed `.js` shadow files that had `.ts`/`.tsx` twins — the final batch of the JS→TS migration. All 148 remaining shadow pairs were reconciled: 130 body-drifted `.ts` pairs (verified TS canonical in all cases), 15 `.tsx` transpiler-noise pairs, and 3 in-sync pairs. `/js-shadow-sync --all` now reports 0 shadows. (`src/`, multiple commits)
- **Search performance optimizations**: Added LRU eviction (max 500 entries) to in-memory search cache. Debounced session search indexing (30s cooldown). Precompiled FTS5 query statement. Enabled `auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL`. (`src/utils/searchCache.ts`, `src/services/sessionSearch/sessionSearchDb.ts`)
- **Prompt suggestions always enabled**: Removed growthbook feature flag gate (`tengu_chomp_inflection`) from prompt suggestion toggle. Setting is now unconditionally available in config UI. (`src/services/PromptSuggestion/promptSuggestion.ts`, `src/components/Settings/Config.tsx`)
- **Colorize ansis API**: Updated from deprecated `ansis.ansi256()`/`ansis.bgAnsi256()` to `ansis.fg()`/`ansis.bg()`. Applied to both `.ts` and `.js` twins. (`src/ink/colorize.ts`, `src/ink/colorize.js`)
- **Auth error retry**: `withRetry` no longer retries auth errors when provider error info is available — avoids infinite retry loops on bad credentials. (`src/services/api/withRetry.ts`)
- **REPL tool JSX clearing**: `/resume` picker local JSX now properly cleared before returning to prompt. (`src/screens/REPL.tsx`)
- **Spinner verbs**: Changed from generic whimsical verbs to Harry Potter-themed phrases. (`src/components/Spinner/whimsy.ts`)
- **File permission dialog**: Symlink resolution failure now gracefully caught with debug log instead of crashing. (`src/components/permissions/FilePermissionDialog/FilePermissionDialog.tsx`)
- **Debug logging**: Added debug logs for SIGINT handler, uncaught exceptions, and invalid settings dialog exit in `main.tsx`.
- **`useTerminalTitle` hook**: Refactored to delegate title-setting to the shared utility. (`src/ink/hooks/use-terminal-title.ts`)
- **`main.tsx`**: Uses shared `setTerminalTitle` with `DEFAULT_TERMINAL_TITLE` constant instead of inline `process.title`. (`src/main.tsx`)
- **Vision/media graceful degradation**: `modelSupportsVision()` now defaults to `false` (instead of `true`) when registry lookup fails. (`src/services/ai/adapter/AnthropicAdapter.ts`)
- **DeepSeek text-only sanitization**: `OpenAICompatibleProvider` now strips `image_url` blocks before sending to DeepSeek's API. (`src/services/ai/providers/OpenAICompatibleProvider.ts`)
- **Rewind UI improvements**: Refined MessageSelector layout — grouped Rewind header, added "Current point" indicator, extracted `DiffStatsSummary` component. (`src/components/MessageSelector.tsx`)

## [0.4.8] — 2026-07-04

### Changed
- **README overhaul**: Rewrote README.md in the style of OpenClaw/Hermes Agent — cleaner layout, feature table, punchier tagline, streamlined install + CLI reference sections. (`README.md`)
- **Task list layout styling**: Changed task list in-progress spinner to a static yellow circle status indicator, and removed strikethroughs from completed tasks. (`src/components/TaskListV2.tsx`)
- **Rebrand `CLAUDE_CODE` → `CLEW_CODE`**: Renamed all `CLAUDE_CODE_*` environment variables, class names, comments, and URLs to `CLEW_CODE_*` across the entire codebase (390 files). Documentation links updated from `code.claude.com` to `clew-code.org`. (`src/`)
- **Soften ultracode effort glow**: Reduced visual intensity of ultracode mode — smaller initial radius (12→4), subtler wave/ring effects, lower saturation variance, reduced feather distance. Makes the purple radial spotlight read better in terminals with coarse background cells. (`src/commands/effort/effort.tsx`)

### Added
- **Project rules system**: Auto-observed behavioral rules scoped to the working repo, stored in `.clew/rules.json`. Includes `ProjectRule` tool (save/list/remove), `/rule` slash command (supports `/rule on`/`/rule off` to toggle), rules injection into system prompt, startup notification, and footer indicator showing rule count (e.g. `3R`). (`src/utils/projectRules.ts`, `src/tools/ProjectRuleTool/`, `src/commands/rule/`)
- **OpenRouter live pricing fallback**: `getModelCosts()` now falls back to live OpenRouter API pricing for unknown models. Fetches `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` on startup, caches to `~/.clew/model-pricing-cache.json` with 6-hour TTL, with prefix matching for model ID resolution. (`src/utils/modelCost.js`, `src/utils/modelCost.ts`)
- **New model pricing entries**: Added pricing for gemini-3.5-flash, gemini-3.1-pro, qwen3.6-plus, glm-5.1, and kimi-k2.6 to `PROVIDER_PRICING`. (`src/utils/modelCost.js`, `src/utils/modelCost.ts`)

### Removed
- **`/mobile` command**: Deleted iOS/Android QR code display command that linked to Claude mobile app — no longer relevant. (`src/commands/mobile/`)
- **`/login` and `/logout` auth commands**: Disabled auth commands entirely — removed login/logout imports and registration from the command registry. (`src/commands.ts`)

### Fixed
- **Resume system crash**: Fixed `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'agentToolResultSchema' before initialization` that caused resume (`/resume`, `--resume`, `--continue`) to crash the app. Root cause: `buildTool` in `Tool.ts` used object spread which eagerly invoked getters like `outputSchema` during module init — for AgentTool, the `agentToolResultSchema` lazy import was still in the temporal dead zone. Fixed by preserving getters via `Object.defineProperties` instead of spread.
- **Bash mode crash from auth import**: Removed `isActiveProviderAnthropic()` import which caused undefined reference crashes in bash mode (`-p` one-shot). (`src/commands.ts`)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE` env alias fallback**: Fixed `getEnvWithAlias()` calls in `envUtils.js` — `CLEW_CONFIG_DIR` was incorrectly aliased to itself instead of `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and `CLEW_CODE_SIMPLE` similarly lacked the `CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE` fallback. (`src/utils/envUtils.js`)

## [0.4.6] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Workflow-backed `/code-review` UI**: Added a local JSX `/code-review` workflow panel with phase navigation, parallel review agents, live token/tool progress, compact task-tree overview, and per-agent detail panes. (`src/commands/code-review/`)
- **`/cd` command**: New slash command to change working directory from the REPL. (`src/commands/cd/`)
- **`/privacy-settings` made local**: Privacy settings now render in-terminal instead of opening a browser. (`src/commands/privacy-settings/`)
- **Peer state persistence**: PeerStore now persists connections, messages, todos, and tags to `~/.clew/peer/state.json` with debounced atomic writes — survives CLI restarts. (`src/peer/PeerStore.ts`, `src/peer/peerPersistence.ts`)
- **Checkpoint on every compaction**: Previously checkpoints only wrote when a goal with `maxTurns` was active. Now every compaction writes a checkpoint snapshot first, so `tryRebuildFromCheckpoint()` always has state to work with. (`src/services/checkpoint/checkpointWriter.ts`)
- **Memory maintenance**: `saveMemory` now deduplicates identical content; `pruneMemories()` removes stale low-value memories on session init. (`src/memory/database.ts`)
- **Cross-peer memory sync**: Replaced broken `/memory/export` + `/peer memory-sync` path with a working `GET /peer-memory-export` endpoint, `src/memory/peerSync.ts` (validation, confidence discount, provenance), and new `peer_memory_sync` tool. (`src/memory/peerSync.ts`, `src/peer/PeerServer.ts`, `src/tools/PeerMemorySyncTool/`)
- **Long-turn recap**: Turns exceeding a threshold (default 5 min) now get an automatic "Goal / Next" recap appended on completion. Configurable via `recapEnabled` / `longTurnRecapThresholdMs`. (`src/services/longTurnRecap.ts`)
- **Provider selection validation**: Provider must be in registry, model must be in registry catalog or live model list. Unverifiable setups (no key, offline, custom endpoints) accepted as before. (`src/services/ai/providerSelection.ts`)

- **Notification placement utility**: New `src/components/notifications/notificationPlacement.ts` for managing notification UI positioning.

- **README rewrite**: Removed fictional model IDs (gpt-5.5 → gemini-2.5-flash), inflated feature counts, unverified claims, and SWE-bench Verified section. Replaced with honest, code-backed descriptions.

- **CI: Install Playwright browsers before tests**: Added `npx playwright install chromium --with-deps` step to ci.yml and publish.yml to fix `BrowserSession` test failure. Made publish job depend on quality job passing.

- **Build: AWAY_SUMMARY flag**: Added `--define.AWAY_SUMMARY=true` to the build script to gate away-summary feature at compile time. (`package.json`)
- **Away summary improvements**: Enhanced prompt to produce structured `Goal: ... Next: ...` output, added `cleanAwaySummary()` to strip prefixes, switched from GB/telemetry gating to `config.recapEnabled` setting. (`src/services/awaySummary.ts`, `src/hooks/useAwaySummary.ts`)
- **Goal blocked/stopped display**: StatusLine now shows `blocked`/`stopped` states with progress bar format changed to `[####-]`. (`src/components/StatusLine.tsx`)

### Removed
- **Fast mode system removed**: Deleted entire fast mode system — `src/utils/fastMode.ts` (470 lines), `/fast` command, `FastIcon` component, `useFastModeNotification` hook, `useShowFastIconHint` hook, and all references across 40+ files (QueryEngine, query.ts, config.ts, main.tsx, AppStateStore, StatusLine, constants/prompts, systemPromptSections, commands.ts, etc.). Fast mode state hardcoded to `'off'`. (`src/utils/fastMode.ts`, `src/commands/fast/`, `src/components/FastIcon.tsx`, `src/hooks/notifs/useFastModeNotification.tsx`, `src/components/PromptInput/useShowFastIconHint.ts`)
- **init-verifiers command**: Removed import from commands.ts. (`src/commands.ts`)
- **`/profile` command removed**: Deleted `src/commands/profile/` — the profile system is now a background state only, no longer user-togglable via slash command. (`src/commands/profile/`, `src/commands.ts`)
- **Duplicate AGENT.md removed**: `AGENT.md` was a subset of `AGENTS.md` — consolidated to single `AGENTS.md`. (`AGENT.md`)

### Changed
- **Context and workflow terminal UI polish**: Refined `/context` category coloring/provider display, redesigned resume-session rows into compact metadata-first entries, and moved selected alert notifications into the LogoV2 header while keeping prompt-only status notices near the input. (`src/components/ContextStats.tsx`, `src/components/LogSelector.tsx`, `src/components/LogoV2/`, `src/components/PromptInput/Notifications.tsx`)
- **`/clear` description updated**: Updated the `/clear` slash command description for clarity.
- **Documentation URL**: Replaced all `clew-code.org/docs` references with `clew-docs.pages.dev` across README, chrome command, IDE command, and preflight checks. (`README.md`, `src/commands/chrome/chrome.tsx`, `src/commands/ide/ide.tsx`, `src/utils/preflightChecks.tsx`)
- **ProcessPeer → ProcessDelegate rename**: Renamed `ProcessPeerTool`/`ProcessPeerProvider` to `ProcessDelegateTool`/`ProcessDelegateProvider` for clearer semantics. Updated all imports across peer, tools, and commands. (`src/tools/ProcessDelegateTool/`, `src/peer/ProcessDelegateProvider.ts`, `src/commands/peer/peer.tsx`, `src/tools.ts`)
- **GoalTool rendering enhancements**: Added React-based tool use summary with truncation preview via `renderToolUseMessage()`, `getToolUseSummary()`, and `summarizeGoalInput()` helpers. (`src/tools/GoalTool/GoalTool.ts`)

### Fixed
- **Anthropic provider registration**: Registered anthropic as a first-class `PROVIDER_REGISTRY` entry. Previously `provider: "anthropic"` was silently rejected and fell back to openai. Anthropic API keys stored in `provider.json` now reach the native client. (`src/services/ai/providers.json`, `src/services/ai/providerRegistry.ts`)
- **`clew provider` CLI rebuilt on registry**: Deleted hardcoded provider table from `provider-select-cli.ts` and the unreferenced legacy `provider-select.js`. Provider selection now reads from `PROVIDER_REGISTRY`. Fixes stale defaults (gpt-4.1-mini on `--reset`) and the `gemini` key writing an unregistered provider id. (`src/commands/provider-select-cli.ts`)
- **gemini → google migration alias**: `normalizeProviderId()` applies legacy alias migration in-memory when `provider.json` loads, to `AI_PROVIDER`, session values, and CLI/slash-command arguments. Legacy `apiKeys` entries copied, not deleted. (`src/services/ai/providerRegistry.ts`)
- **Clew Internal Protocol v1**: Declared Anthropic Messages format as the canonical internal protocol with type aliases and docs. (`src/services/api/clewProtocol.ts`)
- **Provider system architecture docs**: New `docs/architecture/provider-system.md` documenting provider registration, adapter normalization, and the `.js` shadow caveat.

- **Tool input schema render crash**: Guarded UI rendering for dynamic/remote tools whose `inputSchema` is not a Zod schema, and fixed remote permission tool stubs to use a real loose Zod object schema. (`src/utils/safeParseToolInput.ts`, `src/remote/remotePermissionBridge.ts`)
- **Goal evaluation skip when blocked**: Added `!goalState.blocked` check to prevent goal evaluation when the goal is blocked. Removed stale goal turn counter increment in query.ts. (`src/query.ts`)
- **Import path cleanup**: Moved tool constants (`FILE_EDIT_TOOL_NAME`, `TODO_WRITE_TOOL_NAME`, `TASK_CREATE_TOOL_NAME`) to their respective `constants.ts` files; fixed relative→absolute import paths in AppStateStore.ts. (`src/constants/prompts.ts`, `src/state/AppStateStore.ts`)
- **Peer tool de-duplication**: Extracted `clampTimeout()` and `retryUntil()` helpers into `src/tools/peer/peerFeedback.ts`, replacing 12 duplicated timeout-clamping formulas and 2 copy-pasted retry loops across 9 peer tools. (`src/tools/peer/peerFeedback.ts`, `src/tools/PeerPingTool/`, `src/tools/PeerInfoTool/`, `src/tools/PeerRunTool/`, `src/tools/PeerSendMessageTool/`, `src/tools/PeerListMessagesTool/`, `src/tools/PeerDiscoverTool/`, `src/tools/PeerListRolesTool/`, `src/tools/PeerSwarmTool/`, `src/tools/ProcessPeerTool/`)
- **Dead code removal**: Deleted `cost.ts.backup`, removed duplicate `ProviderAdapter` interface in AnthropicAdapter, removed unused `__CODE_INDEX_FEATURE` constant, removed dead `getWorkflowCommands` null placeholder and dead `filePersistence/types.js` stub. (`src/commands/cost/cost.ts.backup`, `src/services/ai/adapter/AnthropicAdapter.ts`, `src/tools.ts`, `src/commands.ts`, `src/utils/filePersistence/types.js`)
- **Debug log cleanup**: Removed 25+ debug `console.log` statements across ResearchTool, semanticSearch, webSearch, dossierGenerator, smartSourceRanking, and fetchProviderModels. (`src/tools/ResearchTool/`, `src/memdir/semanticSearch.ts`, `src/research/collectors/webSearch.ts`, `src/utils/model/fetchProviderModels.ts`)
- **Stale TODO cleanup**: Removed 15+ stale TODOs referencing Anthropic-internal devs (hackyon, paulc), tickets (ANT-344, #23985), completed migrations (onKeyDown, keybindings), and dead systems (Lulu agent). (`src/tools.ts`, `src/utils/advisor.ts`, `src/utils/config.ts`, `src/server/lsp.ts`, `src/services/api/withRetry.ts`, `src/commands/mcp/xaaIdpCommand.ts`, `src/hooks/useVoiceIntegration.tsx`, `src/hooks/useBackgroundTaskNavigation.ts`, `src/hooks/useTypeahead.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSearchInput.ts`, `src/hooks/useHistorySearch.ts`, `src/keybindings/`, `src/components/permissions/ExitPlanModePermissionRequest/`, `src/state/AppState.tsx`)
- **Fix conflicting MemorySearchResult types**: Renamed `MemorySearchResult` in `src/memdir/semanticSearch.ts` to `SemanticMemoryResult` to avoid shadowing the distinct `MemorySearchResult` type in `src/memory/types.ts`. (`src/memdir/semanticSearch.ts`, `src/commands/memory/memorySearch.tsx`)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Peer security hardening**: Auth token (randomUUID) required on all POST endpoints (`/peer-msg`, `/peer-todo`, `/peer-exec`, `/broker/*`, `/peer-queue-cancel`, `/peer-queue-cancel-all`, `/memory/export`). Tokens generated per-instance on server start, written to peer files (`~/.clew/peers/`), and exchanged via UDP beacon for cross-machine auth. (`src/peer/PeerServer.ts`, `src/peer/PeerDiscovery.ts`, `src/peer/PeerStore.ts`)
- **Body size limit**: 10MB max request body on all HTTP endpoints, enforced via Content-Length header check and streaming accumulation. (`src/peer/PeerServer.ts`)
- **Client disconnect handling**: Long-poll broker endpoints and async exec handlers check `res.destroyed` before writing response — prevents errors when client disconnects mid-request. (`src/peer/PeerServer.ts`)
- **Peer token sync in tools**: All tools that discover peers now sync tokens from PeerDiscovery into PeerStore via `populateTokensFromDiscovery()`. (`PeerSendMessageTool`, `PeerRunTool`, `PeerSwarmTool`, `PeerBroadcastTool`, `PeerSetRoleTool`, `PeerSetNameTool`, `PeerDiscoverTool`)

### Changed
- **PeerServer binds 0.0.0.0**: Previously bound to `127.0.0.1` which prevented cross-machine communication despite LAN discovery advertising the real IP. Now listens on all interfaces with per-request token auth. (`src/peer/PeerServer.ts`)
- **Peer share passes server token to discovery**: `PeerShareTool`, `main.tsx`, `agentLoop.ts`, `peer.tsx`, `PeerMenu.tsx` all pass `server.token` to `discovery.startAdvertising()` so the peer file and UDP beacon carry the correct auth token. (`src/tools/PeerShareTool/PeerShareTool.ts`)

### Removed
- **WebSocket dead code**: Removed unused `wsClients` set, `upgrade` event listener, and `handleWebSocketUpgrade()` method — WebSocket chat was never implemented. (`src/peer/PeerServer.ts`)
- **Host header check**: Removed ALLOWED_HOSTS / `checkHostHeader()` — was redundant with per-request token auth and blocked LAN peers. (`src/peer/PeerServer.ts`)
- **Unused `PROTECTED_POST` constant**: Documentation-only constant for protected endpoints, never actually used in code. (`src/peer/PeerServer.ts`)

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- **LSP Tool enabled by default**: Removed `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL` env gate — LSP tool is now always registered and available without environment variable. (`src/tools.ts`)
- **Agent Tool enabled for AI model**: Registered `AgentTool` in `getAllBaseTools()` so the AI model can directly invoke subagents via the Agent tool with `subagent_type`. Previously only accessible through `/agent` slash command. (`src/tools.ts`)

### Fixed
- **Startup crash in proxy module**: `bun run dev` crashed with `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'ofetch.defaults.proxy = void 0')` in `configureGlobalAgents()`. The `proxy.js`/`proxy.ts` files were partially migrated from `axios` to `ofetch` v1.5.1 but retained axios-specific APIs (`ofetch.defaults`, `ofetch.interceptors.request`) that don't exist in ofetch v1.x. Rewrote `createFetchInstance()` to use `ofetch.create()` with undici dispatcher (Node.js) or Bun-native `proxy` option, and simplified `configureGlobalAgents()` to only use `undici.setGlobalDispatcher()`. (`src/utils/proxy.js`, `src/utils/proxy.ts`, `src/cli/transports/ccrClient.ts`)

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **`/fork` command**: New slash command that forks the current conversation into a new session, leaving the original intact. Use `/resume <session-id>` to return to the original. (`src/commands/fork/`)

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- **`clew update` simplified**: Replaced complex multi-path update system (~370 lines) with a simple `npm install -g clew-code@latest` exec call (~35 lines). Removed installation type detection, lock mechanism, native/local installer fallbacks, and auto-relaunch. The current session continues running uninterrupted. (`src/cli/update.ts`)
- **`autoUpdater.ts` simplified**: Removed `installGlobalPackage()`, lock mechanism, and package manager detection — kept only `getLatestVersion()`, `getNpmDistTags()`, `assertMinVersion()`, `classifyUpdateError()`. (~745→~430 lines) (`src/utils/autoUpdater.ts`)
- **`localInstaller.ts` simplified**: Removed `installOrUpdateClaudePackage()` and installation helpers — kept only `localInstallationExists()`. (~162→~35 lines) (`src/utils/localInstaller.ts`)
- **Background auto-updater simplified**: `AutoUpdater.tsx` now only shows "Update available" notification instead of auto-installing. Removed `NativeAutoUpdater.tsx` and `PackageManagerAutoUpdater.tsx`. Simplified `AutoUpdaterWrapper.tsx`. (`src/components/AutoUpdater.tsx`)
- **Peer system UX improvements**: `peer_send_message` now defaults `waitResponse: true` (most common case). `/peer` menu auto-discovers LAN peers on open. Fixed variable shadowing bug in PeerMenu peers view. Added `PeerIndicator` showing connected peer count in REPL footer. (`src/tools/PeerSendMessageTool/`, `src/commands/peer/`, `src/components/PeerIndicator.tsx`)
- **`process_peer` renamed to `delegate`**: Renamed tool from `process_peer` to `delegate` to avoid confusion with LAN P2P system. Updated all references in prompts, profiles, and types. (`src/tools/ProcessPeerTool/`, `src/skills/bundled/personalDelegate.ts`, `src/constants/profilePrompts.ts`, `src/types/tools.ts`)

### Fixed
- **MACRO globals not set at build time**: `clew update` crashed with `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Fy.PACKAGE_URL')` because `MACRO.PACKAGE_URL` was never injected into the bundle. Added `scripts/postbuild-inject-macro.mjs` that reads `package.json` and prepends `var MACRO={...}` to `dist/main.js` at build time.

### Removed
- **`/looplock`**: Removed the `/looplock` command — it was redundant with `/daemon start` + `/task`. Replaced UI hints with `/task` and `/daemon` throughout.
- **`/agents`**: Removed the `/agents` command — it was identical to `/agent view`. Moved `getAgentViewDisabledReason` utility to `src/cli/handlers/agents.ts`.
- **17 dead stub commands**: Removed `ant-trace`, `backfill-sessions`, `break-cache`, `bughunter`, `ctx_viz`, `debug-tool-call`, `env`, `good-claude`, `issue`, `mock-limits`, `oauth-refresh`, `onboarding`, `perf-issue`, `reset-limits`, `share`, `summary`, `teleport` — all were `isEnabled: () => false, isHidden: true` stubs. Also removed the `INTERNAL_ONLY_COMMANDS` array and its conditional inclusion.

### Added
- **Compact Orchestrator**: Added `src/services/compact/orchestrator.ts` as a unified entry point for all compaction strategies (micro-compaction, session-memory, and auto-compaction).
- **Cross-platform Computer Use Tool**: Unifed the computer use execution paths by routing the primary `ComputerUseTool` through the new platform-native adapter (`getPlatformAdapter()`). Added support for macOS and Linux in addition to Windows when `ENABLE_COMPUTER_USE=1` is specified.
- **User-visible fallback warning**: Added a console warning message printed to stderr when `COMPUTER_USE_BACKEND="anthropic"` is explicitly requested but the `@ant/computer-use-mcp` or `@ant/computer-use-input` packages are missing.

### Changed
- **Auto-compact threshold adjusted**: Changed background auto-compact min threshold percentage (`BACKGROUND_AUTOCOMPACT_MIN_THRESHOLD_PCT`) from `0.8` to `0.65` to trigger background compaction earlier.
- **CLAUDE → CLEW full rename**: Renamed all remaining `.claude/` → `.clew/` directory references, `getClaudeConfigHomeDir` → `getClewConfigHomeDir` (83 files), `CLAUDE_FOLDER_PERMISSION_PATTERN` → `CLEW_FOLDER_PERMISSION_PATTERN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DOCS_MAP_URL` → `CLEW_CODE_DOCS_MAP_URL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE_AGENT_TYPE` → `CLEW_CODE_GUIDE_AGENT_TYPE`. Updated `.npmignore`, `.gitignore`, permission scope strings, env var fallbacks, readme translations (12 languages), and comments throughout.
- **PlatformAdapter automation extension**: Extended `PlatformAdapter` with `mouseDown`, `mouseUp`, `holdKey`, `listWindows`, and `focusWindow` methods, implementing them for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and refactoring `ComputerUseTool` Action Handler to use these adapter methods directly instead of `require('./input.js')` fallbacks.
- **URL rebranding**: Replaced all `claude.ai` and `claude.com` URLs with `clew-code.org` across OAuth config, product links, usage, desktop, chrome, privacy, and prompts. Removed Anthropic production OAuth endpoints. (`535d2c8`, `38c0b19`, `37c48ac`)
- **`/login` and `/logout` now gateway-native**: Commands use gateway mode by default when `isGatewayConfigured()` returns true. `/login` type changed to `'local'`, `/logout` type changed to `'local'` — both load gateway-specific modules (`gwlogin.ts`, `gwlogout.ts`). (`src/commands/login/index.ts`, `src/commands/logout/index.ts`)
- **Interrupted prompt renamed**: "Interrupted by user" message now branded as "Clew". (`src/components/InterruptedByUser.tsx`)
- **README restructured**: Moved Install, Quick start, Provider setup above Features for better flow. Updated provider count 28→27. Removed GenerateImage/GenerateVideo from features list.
- **README cleaned**: Removed all "fork of Claude Code" and "reverse-engineered" references. Fixed `check:ci` description. Fixed peer docs link → wiki.
- **Onboarding wizard redesigned**: New flow: Theme → Provider (all 27) → API Key → Model → Done. Removed Auth method selector, OAuth login, terminal settings step. Removed Anthropic Claude from provider list.
- **AGENTS.md updated**: Added gateway mode, dashboard deployment instructions, removed commands section. (`e6ed8e8`)
- **Screenshot scaling and compression**: Unified screenshot output to JPEG quality 75 with scaling on Windows platform adapter to match the canonical tool behavior.

### Fixed
- **Clipboard race condition in `typeText`**: Fixed race condition where text typing via clipboard paste would overwrite user clipboard without locking/restoring, and synchronized the logic across Windows platform paths.
- **Workflow test paths**: Updated `tests/commands/workflow.test.ts` to use `.clew/runs/` instead of `.claude/runs/`, fixing 4 failing tests on Windows.
- **Auth logout message**: Changed "Successfully logged out from your Anthropic account" to generic "Successfully logged out." for gateway compatibility.

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed unregistered commands (`extra-usage`, `tag`, `remote-setup`, `vim`), commented-out tools (`BrowserAgentTool`, `MultiSearchTool`), and Anthropic-gated tools (`ConfigTool`, `TungstenTool`, `REPLTool`). Cleaned up imports and references across tools.ts, caches.ts, and REPL.tsx. Approximately 1,900 lines removed.
- **docs/ directory**: Deleted all static HTML docs (44 files). Documentation moved to GitHub Wiki.
- **Sensitive files untracked**: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/skills/graphify/`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.clew/taste/` — removed from git tracking.
- **Gitignore updated**: Added `.obsi/`, `.claude/`, `.claudeignore`, `ClewCode.wiki`, `test/`, `tests/`, `examples/` to `.gitignore`.
- **Unintended assets**: Removed website assets from main repo after moving website to separate repo. (`d25393d`)

### Changed
- **MCP docs URL rebranded**: Changed all `code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp` references to `https://clew-code.org` across 5 files (MCP dialog, settings, warnings, panel, and config suggestions).
- **Windows clipboard now uses PowerShell Set-Clipboard**: `clip.exe` corrupts non-ASCII text (Thai, Japanese, emoji, etc.) due to console code page limitations. Replaced with `powershell.exe Set-Clipboard` forced to UTF-8 stdin. Windows is also now counted as `'native'` clipboard path in `getClipboardPath()`. Both `.ts` source and `.js` mirror updated.

### Removed
- **`.mcp.json` untracked**: Added to `.gitignore` and removed from git tracking (contains `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **`schema._zod.def` crash during tool API schema conversion**: `zodToJsonSchema()` now checks for `_zod` branding before calling `toJSONSchema()`, preventing crashes when a non-Zod value is passed as a tool schema. Added warning log to identify the offending tool.
- **`generateSettingsJSONSchema()` crash**: Wrapped `toJSONSchema()` call in `schemaOutput.ts` and `.js` with try-catch to gracefully handle Zod v4 serialization failures for complex schemas.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **PeerStore infinite recursion hang**: Removed 7 duplicate "alias" methods (`addPeer`, `getPeerByPort`, `findPeer`, `setPeerName`, `setPeerRole`, `getPeerTags`, `getAllPeerTags`) that overrode their real implementations and called themselves recursively, causing `Maximum call stack size exceeded` and hanging the app during `peer_discover`.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- **Peer memory sync**: `/peer memory sync` imports memories from all connected peers into local MemoryDB via new `/memory/export` HTTP endpoint. Each peer returns top-50 memories ordered by importance; upsert ensures idempotent cross-machine deduplication.
- **Peer memory auto‑sync**: `/peer memory auto on [minutes]` schedules periodic memory sync via cron system (default 60 min, min 15, max 1440). `/peer memory auto off` cancels the cron task. Runs an initial sync immediately on enable.
- **Memory system dashboard**: `/memory dashboard` shows a unified view of profile, MemoryDB stats, Dream, Distill, Peer auto-sync state, and recent timeline events.
- **Legacy migration**: `migrateFromSessionDB()` reads old `session-memory.db` (sessions, digests, topics) and upserts into MemoryDB with deterministic keys. Auto-runs during `/memory init`. `queryTimeline()` now reads from MemoryDB as primary source, falls back to legacy DB.
- **Removed redundant files**: Deleted `autoExtract.ts`, `consolidator.ts`, `index.ts`, `prompts.ts` from `src/services/longTermMemory/`.
- **Redirected longTermMemory to MemoryDB**: `dream.ts`, `graph.ts`, `experience.ts`, `consolidate.ts`, `crossSession.ts` all now read/write to MemoryDB instead of their own SQLite DB or JSON files. Exports stay the same — zero breakage for callers like `/memory graph`, `/memory xp`, `/memory timeline`, `/memory dashboard`.
- **autoDream logs to MemoryDB**: `dream_completed` event written to `memory_timeline` after each Dream run, so dashboard can show dream status without reading old state files.

### Changed
- **Hidden `clew-gateway` provider**: Filtered out from `PROVIDER_IDS` so it no longer appears in `/providers` or `/model` selectors.
- **Removed Anthropic provider**: Since clew-gateway + cline providers cover Anthropic models, the standalone `anthropic` entry (models, UI sub-menus, OAuth login, provider class) has been removed from the provider system. Use Claude Code directly for Anthropic-first workflows.
- **`/model` now fetches from API for all providers**: `supportsModelFetching()` expanded from a 14-provider whitelist to all providers (except google-assist). Every provider tries its `/models` endpoint first; if unavailable, falls back to static models in `providers.json`.
- **`/peer swarm`**: New command that sends a shell command to ALL connected peers in parallel via `/peer-exec`, collects and displays aggregated results. Supports `--timeout`, `--filter`, and `--dry-run` flags.
- **`peer_swarm` tool**: New AI-callable tool that runs a shell command on all connected peers in parallel and returns aggregated results. Analogous to `peer_broadcast` but for `/peer-exec` instead of `/peer-todo`.
- **In-process message broker**: New endpoints on PeerServer — `POST /broker/send`, `GET /broker/recv` (long-poll), `POST /broker/reply`. Messages are queued in PeerStore with delivery tracking, correlation IDs, and waiter resolution. No new process needed — runs inside existing `/peer share` server.
- **Peer task dashboard**: New `formatPeerTaskDashboard()` utility, `/peer dashboard` command, and `peer_dashboard` AI tool. Shows connected peers, their assigned tasks (with status), and result summaries in a collapsed format — giving the AI full visibility into peer work as a "checklist person".
- **MemoryDB — SQLite-backed memory store**: New `src/memory/database.ts` + `src/memory/schema.ts` implementing a durable memory system with `memories` table (importance, confidence, access_count, type) and `memory_timeline` table (event lifecycle tracking). Supports budgeted querying by importance × recency ranking, auto-eviction, and timeline event logging.
- **Memory hierarchy**: New `src/memory/hierarchy.ts` for managing `.clew/memory/` directory with MEMORY.md, DECISIONS.md, TASTE.md, task directories. Auto-initializes on first use.
- **Budgeted injection**: New `src/memory/budgetInjector.ts` for importance-ranked memory injection into system prompt. Loads file hierarchy + SQLite memories, ranks by importance × confidence × recency, and fits into configurable token budget.
- **`/memory scan`**: New subcommand that scans the repo, detects stack/language/package-manager/entrypoints/provider-architecture, and bootstraps seed memories into MemoryDB + MEMORY.md/DECISIONS.md/TASTE.md.
- **`/memory rebuild`**: New subcommand to reconstruct context from memories using budgeted injection. Shows per-memory detail (key, type, importance, score, tokens), budget usage, and skipped memories with reasons.
- **`/memory scan` idempotent**: Scanner uses deterministic keys (`scan.*`) with upsert. Output shows created/updated/unchanged counts. Content-hash change detection skips unchanged entries.
- **`/memory recall`**: New subcommand that recalls memories ranked by combined score (importance×0.3 + confidence×0.15 + recency×0.2 + access_count×0.1). Bumps access_count on recall. Supports `--verbose` for score breakdown.
- **`/memory feedback`**: New subcommand supporting 7 signals (accepted, rejected, corrected, preferred, disliked, important, wrong). Updates importance/confidence deltas, writes `preferred` signals to TASTE.md, and records all events in memory_timeline.
- **MemoryDB hardening**: Added upsertMemory (INSERT OR REPLACE by key), findByKey, deleteMemoryByKey, recallMemories with scoring, and content-hash change detection.
- **recall relevance scoring**: Added lexical relevance computation (0..1) between query and memory content/key/type. New score formula: relevance×0.45 + importance×0.20 + recency×0.15 + access×0.10 + confidence×0.10. `--verbose` shows all 5 components.
- **feedback aliases**: Added signal aliases (`correct`→corrected, `incorrect`→wrong, `like`→preferred, `dislike`→disliked). Only canonical signals stored in memory_timeline.
- **In-compact memory extraction**: Compact prompt now asks LLM to output `<memories>` block with structured facts (`[decision]`, `[architecture]`, `[taste]`, `[bug]`, etc.). `parseCompactMemories()` extracts them, `autoExtractFromSession()` saves to MemoryDB + markdown files. Works for both manual `/compact` and auto-compact. Shows `N memories extracted` in status line.
- **Dream → MemoryDB**: After Dream consolidation runs, `syncDreamToMemoryDB()` reads updated markdown files and upserts tagged lines into MemoryDB (SQLite). Bridges Dream's file-based consolidation with structured memory store.
- **Distill → MemoryDB**: Rewrote `autoDistill()` to query MemoryDB for recent memories instead of file-based digests. Extracts patterns from memory types and content themes; generates skill suggestions from MemoryDB data.
- **Fix GoalTool crash**: Added missing `mapToolResultToToolResultBlockParam` method to GoalTool (required by `Tool` interface but never defined). Fixes runtime `$.mapToolResultToToolResultBlockParam is not a function` error when Goal tool was called.
- **Hide auto-compact %**: Removed `N% until auto-compact` display from TokenWarning component — only shown when context is actually low.
- **Memory types**: Added `task_progress`, `command`, `note` to MEMORY_TYPES schema.
- **Memory tests**: 8 new tests covering upsert idempotency, content-hash change detection, recall ranking by relevance, access_count increment, feedback effects (important, preferred→TASTE.md, wrong→confidence), signal alias resolution, and budgeted query limits.
- **Auto memory lifecycle**: `ensureMemorySystem()` auto-inits DB + auto-scans on first access. Budgeted memories auto-injected into system prompt every turn via `loadBudgetedMemory()`. `memory_feedback` AI tool lets the agent give feedback directly without human typing.

## [0.2.33] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **REPL TDZ errors at startup**: Moved `restoreReadFileState` and `processInitialMessage` effect to before their dependent `const` declarations, fixing `Cannot access X before initialization` render errors. Added optional chaining for `initialMessages?.length` in dependency array. (`src/screens/REPL.tsx`)

## [0.2.32] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- Version now baked at build time via `prebuild-version.mjs` instead of reading `package.json` at runtime. Fixes `clew update` showing stale version for npm-global installs.

### Changed
- Removed stale `--define.MACRO.*` flags from package.json scripts (VERSION, PACKAGE_URL, FEEDBACK_CHANNEL, ISSUES_EXPLAINER). These values are now supplied by `src/generated/version.ts`, auto-generated before build/dev.

## [0.2.31] — 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **Install scripts auto-open terminal**: After installation, `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now open a new terminal window with `clew` ready to run — no need to manually open a new shell. (`scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/install.ps1`)
- **README install section**: Added one-liner install instructions (`curl | bash` and `irm | iex`) with the install scripts. (`README.md`)

### Fixed

- **Suppress blank assistant messages**: Filtered out assistant messages containing only system reminders so they do not render as empty `▶` bullet points in the terminal UI.
- **Fix provider/model session bleed**: `/providers set` without `--global` no longer writes to `provider.json`, preventing provider/model changes in one session from affecting other sessions. Only `--global` persists the selection. (`src/commands/provider-select/provider-select.ts`)
- **Remove sharp from optionalDependencies**: Sharp's install script fails on Windows without build tools. All sharp imports are dynamic with fallbacks — removed from package.json so `npm install -g clew-code` works everywhere. Install sharp separately for image processing features. (`package.json`, `src/tools/FileReadTool/imageProcessor.ts`)
- **Install scripts**: New `scripts/install.sh` (Unix) and `scripts/install.ps1` (Windows) that auto-install bun then run `bun install -g clew-code`. No manual setup needed. (`scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/install.ps1`)
- **Node 12 compatibility**: Use `||` instead of `??` in `bin/clew.cjs` to support Node.js 12 (npm's global shim runs the entry point with Node before spawning bun). (`bin/clew.cjs`)
- **`clew update` uses wrong package manager**: When clew was installed via `bun install -g`, running `clew update` still ran `npm install -g` — installing the new version in npm's global dir while the shell still found the bun-installed old version. Now uses the same package manager that installed it (`bun` vs `npm`). (`src/utils/autoUpdater.ts`)

## [0.2.28] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Personal profile overhaul**: Rewrote `PERSONAL_PROFILE_PROMPT` with delegation, memory-driven learning, proactive skill creation, scheduling, and autonomy instructions. Personal profile now acts as a personal AI control center. (`src/constants/profilePrompts.ts`)

- **`/delegate` bundled skill**: New personal profile skill for delegating coding work to a Codex worker via `process_peer`. Creates structured tasks with goal, scope, constraints, and validation. Aliases: `/code`, `/worker`. (`src/skills/bundled/personalDelegate.ts`)

- **Personal profile documentation**: New `docs/personal-profile.html` page covering delegation workflow, memory-driven learning, skill creation, scheduling, and coding vs personal profile comparison. Updated `docs/commands.html` with `/profile` command reference.

- **Streaming text display**: Removed Windows viewport yank bug gate that prevented real-time streaming text on Windows. Streaming text now shows full content character-by-character instead of line-by-line. (`src/screens/REPL.tsx`)

- **Cross-provider model context lookup**: `toProviderModelInfo()` now searches all provider registries for model context window info when the current provider doesn't have the model in its registry. Fixes missing `maxContext`/`maxOutput` for models like `deepseek-v4-flash-free` on OpenCode. (`src/services/ai/providerModels.ts`)

- **RTK (Rust Token Killer) integration**: BashTool now auto-detects `rtk` and wraps shell commands to compress output before it enters the context window. Reduces token consumption by 60-90% on common dev commands. (`src/utils/Shell.ts`)

### Removed

- **`/commit-push-pr` command, `PRTool`, `SuggestBackgroundPRTool`**: All git/PR tooling consolidated to `BashTool` for `git`/`gh` commands. Deleted `src/commands/commit-push-pr.ts`, `src/tools/PRTool/`, `src/tools/SuggestBackgroundPRTool/`. (ponytail: BashTool covers all git/PR operations, no need for wrappers)

- **`/mode` slash command**: Removed in favor of the existing `shift+tab` keyboard shortcut for mode switching. The command was duplicating functionality already covered by the shortcut. (ponytail: deletion over addition)

### Fixed

- **`clew update` showing wrong version / not updating**: Added missing `MACRO.VERSION`, `MACRO.PACKAGE_URL`, `MACRO.FEEDBACK_CHANNEL`, and `MACRO.ISSUES_EXPLAINER` compile-time defines to `dev`, `start`, and `build` scripts in `package.json`. These Bun `--define` constants were not being injected, causing the updater to compare against `undefined` and never detect or install the correct version.
- **Empty response retry for reasoning models**: `OpenAICompatibleAdapter.streamMessage` now catches `empty_response` errors and retries once without `reasoning_effort`. Some models (e.g. minimax-m3 via OpenAI-compatible proxy) return empty content when `reasoning_effort` is sent; the auto-retry bypasses this without per-model configuration. (ponytail: generic fix, no per-model config needed)
- Personal profile UI now redraws the frozen header as `Clew Personal`, hides the workspace path in condensed mode, and keeps the persona visible in the prompt footer.
- **GenerateImageTool ENOENT crash**: Replaced runtime `readFileSync` of `providers.json` with build-time JSON import, fixing `ENOENT: no such file or directory` when the bundled CLI resolves `import.meta.dirname` to `dist/` instead of `src/tools/GenerateImageTool/`.
- Assistant text now strips leading blank lines before Markdown render, so empty-looking `⏵` rows no longer appear ahead of the actual response text.
- API client debug messages now use the debug logger instead of `console.error`, preventing Ink from rendering internal stream diagnostics as blank assistant turns.
- **Moonshot/Kimi 400 on tool schemas**: `normalizeOpenAIToolInputSchema` no longer forces `type: "object"` at the root when the schema carries `anyOf`/`oneOf` (e.g. `z.union` / `z.discriminatedUnion` at the tool root). Fixes `tools.function.parameters is not a valid moonshot flavored json schema: when using anyOf, type should be defined in anyOf items instead of the parent schema` for `FileReadTool`, `PRTool`, `SendMessageTool`, etc.
- **Compaction crash on models without vision**: `stripImagesFromMessages` now also strips `video` content blocks (both top-level and nested in `tool_result`), fixing `model does not accept image or video input` errors on models like GLM-5.1 during `/compact`.
- **DeepSeek 400 on tool schemas with `anyOf`/`oneOf`**: Reverted the Moonshot/Kimi workaround from `normalizeOpenAIToolInputSchema` that dropped `type: "object"` for all providers with union schemas — this broke DeepSeek which requires it. Moonshot-specific type stripping is now done in the adapter's `convertToOpenAI` where provider-specific logic belongs.
- **Empty assistant response shows blank ▶**: `AssistantTextMessage` now shows `Model returned an empty response` (dimmed) instead of returning null and leaving a bare `▶` indicator when the model sends back no content. Also detects empty streams in the OpenAI-compatible adapter (`wrapStream`) and throws a structured `empty_response` error so users see a clear failure instead of a silent empty turn.

### Added

- **Bounded tool output + ReadArtifact tool**: Large tool outputs are truncated to 200 lines with the full output saved to disk. A `ReadArtifact(file_path, offset, limit)` tool allows the agent to read persisted outputs in line-based chunks, preventing context overflow from large logs.
- **Profile system** (`/profile`): Users can switch between `coding` (default — file editing, validation, implementation) and `personal` (command center — planning, task splitting, delegation to coding workers). Active profile is shown in the footer. Profile is persisted across sessions. Each profile remembers its last permission mode and restores it on switch (personal defaults to `ask`). Profile-specific prompts are injected into the system prompt to guide LLM behavior.
- **Video input support**: Users can now paste video files (mp4, mov, webm, etc.) into the REPL and send them to video-capable models (Gemini 3.1/2.5, GPT-5.5/5.4). Video blocks are converted to `image_url` base64 data URIs for OpenAI-compatible APIs. Includes paste handler detection, orphaned cleanup, history restore, and UI label rendering.
- **Image & Video generation tools**: Two new AI-callable tools — `GenerateImage` (DALL-E 3 / Imagen 3 / OpenRouter) and `GenerateVideo` (Runway Gen-4). Models can generate images and videos via tool use. Auto-discover image models from provider APIs. Auto-enabled when the respective API keys are configured (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `RUNWAY_API_KEY`).
- **Execution modes** (`/mode`): Five user-facing execution modes — `safe` (ask before edits), `yolo` (auto-approve normal tools), `afk` (auto-run + summarize), `review-only` (read only, no edits), `browser-safe` (browser allowed, no destructive bash). Footer shows current mode badge. Maps to existing permission modes underneath.
- **Goal system improvements**: `/goal` now integrates with AFK mode (auto-switch). Heuristic pre-check saves LLM evaluation cost (build exit code, test output, lint results). Goal templates (`/goal fix-build`, `green-tests`, `refactor`, `fix-lint`, `fix-typecheck`). Goal chains with `then` syntax (`/goal "lint passes" then "tests pass"`). Evaluator sees tool results directly.
- **Structured checkpoint system**: New `src/services/checkpoint/checkpointWriter.ts` — captures structured task state at 20%, 45%, and 70% progress milestones. Checkpoints record files modified, commands run, decisions made, blockers, and next steps. Integrated with QueryEngine turn counting and GoalState tracking.
- **Session rebuild from checkpoints**: Enhanced `src/services/compact/compact.ts` — when autoCompact runs, it first checks for existing checkpoints and rebuilds context from the latest checkpoint + delta messages. Falls back to LLM summarization if no checkpoints exist. Preserves more detail than pure summarization.
- **Automated Dream process**: New `src/services/longTermMemory/dream.ts` — 7-day memory consolidation cycle. Groups sessions from the past week, merges duplicate insights, deduplicates topic_index entries, creates weekly digests with patterns, and prunes low-value records. Runs automatically on session start.
- **Automated Distill process**: New `src/services/longTermMemory/distill.ts` — 30-day pattern extraction cycle. Analyzes weekly digests, identifies recurring patterns (file types, tool usage, problem categories), creates experience records, and generates reusable skill suggestions. Keeps 12 months of experiences.


## [0.2.22] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Team dashboard**: New `/team` slash command opens real-time dashboard of all in-process teammates with status, activity, tool/token counts, and drill-down detail view.
- **Teammate badge**: Footer bar now shows live count of running teammates (e.g. `2Tm`).
- **Memory store system**: New `src/context/memoryStore.ts` — persistent key-value context store with SQLite backend for agent-learned facts and preferences.
- **Auto-memory capture**: New `src/context/autoMemory.ts` — automatically captures lessons from FileEdit/Write/Bash tool results, extracts tags and decisions, and persists to memory store, knowledge graph, and session history with XP awards.
- **Memory UI components**: Ink TUI components for memory browsing (`MemoryList`), timeline (`MemoryTimeline`), and stats dashboard (`MemoryStats`) with activity sparklines and expertise XP bars.
- **Semantic search**: Embedding-based search in `src/memory/search.ts` using Xenova Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) as a boost on top of FTS5, with graceful fallback.

### Changed

- **Migrated `.claude/` → `.clew/`**: All project-level config (agents, skills, workflows, settings) moved from `.claude/` to `.clew/`. Source code strings updated across 40+ files. `.gitignore` updated to track `.clew/` instead of `.claude/`.

### Fixed

- Remove ⏵⏵ mode-change notification banner on permission switch
- Rebrand `/memory` description from "Edit Claude memory files" to "Edit Clew memory files"
- Fix `updateConfig` Zod v4 schema shape access (`_def.shape` is object, not method)

### Removed

- Remove `scripts/` directory from repository (already in `.gitignore`, ~2.5K lines deleted)
- Remove temp screenshot PNGs (`docs-index-check.png`, `docs-peer-check.png`) from root
- Remove `package-lock.json` (using `bun.lock` exclusively)
- Remove `index.json` cache and `scratch/` directory from root

## [0.2.16] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Auto-relaunch after update**: `UpdateDialog.startInstall()` now spawns a detached child process immediately after `bun/npm install -g` completes and exits — no more manual restart required. The new version launches automatically.

## [0.2.15] — 2026-06-14


## [0.2.14] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Peer task queue system**: `PeerServer` now supports queuing commands when busy (`/peer-exec`). Tasks are queued with priority levels (`low`/`normal`/`high`), auto-dequeued when the server is free, and exposed via `/peer-queue-status`, `/peer-queue-cancel`, `/peer-queue-cancel-all` endpoints with SSE queue events.
- **Peer health monitoring**: `peerHealth.ts` with `getPeerHealth()` (healthy/lagging/offline), `formatPeerLatency()`, and `summarizePeers()`. PeerStore tracks liveness ping latency (`latencyMs`), busy/queue state, and connection errors.
- **Long-term memory system**: New module `src/services/longTermMemory/` with auto-extraction (`autoExtract.ts`), session consolidation (`consolidate.ts`, `consolidator.ts`), cross-session history (`crossSession.ts`), timeline querying (`timeline.ts`), and `prompts.ts` — all exported via `index.ts`.
- **Session memory consolidation**: `src/services/SessionMemory/consolidation.ts` parses notes sections, de-duplicates redundant content, and compacts session memory into structured summaries.
- **Gemini Code Assist provider**: `CodeAssistProvider.ts` — OAuth-based Google Code Assist provider with token caching and project ID detection, registered as `google-assist` in `CLI_PROVIDER_DEFAULTS`.
- **Dashboard Monitor**: `DashboardMonitor.tsx` — real-time agent, daemon, and task execution monitor with tabbed views (queue, agents, timeline).
- **Fallback UI**: `fallbackUI.ts` — strips unsupported ANSI escape sequences on legacy Windows consoles (conhost.exe) and non-TTY terminals.
- **Windows terminal utilities**: `windowsTerminal.ts` (console detection, ANSI support checks) and `windowsEncoding.ts` (code page handling).
- **Local provider keys store**: `localProviderKeys.ts` for managing per-provider API keys.
- **Auto-relaunch on update**: `main.tsx` now spawns a child process before shutting down during auto-update, so the new version launches immediately without manual re-run.
- **Auto-ingest workspace memory**: `setup.ts` calls `autoIngestWorkspaceMemory(cwd)` asynchronously on startup to load workspace-level memories.

### Changed

- **peer → swarm rename**: All `src/commands/peer/` → `src/commands/swarm/` and docs (`peer.html` → `swarm.html`, `peer.th.html` → `swarm.th.html`). Import references updated across `commands.ts`, components, and tools.
- **PeerStore fields**: Extended `PeerInfo` with `isBusy`, `queueDepth`, `latencyMs`, `lastConnectionError`. On liveness pings, latency is measured via `performance.now()`.
- **`/agents` command registered**: New `agentsCmd` imported and added to the command registry.
- **Docs regenerated**: HTML docs rebuilt to reflect peer terminology and latest features.

### Fixed

- Fixed `displayName?.startsWith()` optional chaining in `PeerStore` (removed redundant `displayName &&` guard).

## [0.2.13] — 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **Formatting pass**: Trailing commas and line breaks fixed across the codebase via Biome.
- **bun.lock synchronized**: Lockfile updated to match updated `package.json` dependencies.

## [0.2.12] — 2026-06-13

### Added

- **PR #37 — Provider consolidation & Zod v4 migration**:
  - `GoogleProvider` and `ClewGatewayProvider` now extend `OpenAICompatibleProvider`, eliminating 679 lines of duplicated HTTP client/streaming/error-handling logic.
  - Deleted `GoogleAdapter.ts` (496 lines) — no longer needed after consolidation.
  - Migrated `.passthrough()` → `.loose()` and `z.object({}).passthrough()` → `z.looseObject({})` across 7 files for Zod v4 compatibility.
  - Refactored `PR` command and `PRTool` list/status to use `--json` + `JSON.parse` instead of `--jq`.
  - Renamed SDK type files `runtimeTypes.d.ts` → `runtimeTypes.ts` and `toolTypes.d.ts` → `toolTypes.ts` for consistency.
  - Updated dependencies: `@agentclientprotocol/sdk@^0.25.1`, `@ai-sdk/*`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk@^0.104.1`, `@aws-sdk/*@^3.1068.0`, `@commander-js/extra-typings@^15.0.0`, and others.

## [0.2.11] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **UpdateDialog mascot removal**: Removed CLAWD mascot entirely to avoid terminal-dependent layout breakages on Windows and non-UTF-8 terminals.
- **UpdateDialog box border alignment**: Fixed layout by treating block characters (`─`, `│`) as double-width for proper box-drawing alignment.

## [0.2.10] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **CLI early input capture during update dialog**: `cli.ts` now defers stdin listening until after the update dialog resolves, preventing the keyboard from freezing when the dialog appears.
- **UpdateDialog stdin consumption**: Removed `createInterface` call that was consuming stdin and blocking keypress events during the update prompt.

## [0.2.9] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **UpdateDialog layout alignment**: Fixed layout misalignment in the update notification dialog and enabled arrow-key navigation for Yes/No options.

## [0.2.8] — 2026-06-12

### Added

### Fixed

- **`reasoning_effort` 400 error on unsupported models**: `getOpenAIReasoningEffort()` now checks both provider-level (`reasoningEffort` capability) and model-level (`reasoning` capability) before sending `reasoning_effort` to OpenAI-compatible APIs. If the model is not in the registry, `reasoning_effort` is skipped conservatively — preventing 400 errors on models like `codestral-latest`, `deepseek-v4-flash-free`, and `stepfun/step-3.7-flash:free`.

- **Update dialog not showing when npm is unavailable**: The auto-update system (`getLatestVersion()`, `getNpmDistTags()`) now has a 3-tier fallback strategy — tries `npm view` first, then `bun x npm` when running on Bun, and finally fetches directly from the npm registry HTTP API. This ensures the interactive update dialog appears even when users don't have `npm` installed. The silent `catch` in `main.tsx` was also replaced with a `logForDebugging` call so update failures are no longer swallowed without trace.

- **`installOrUpdateClaudePackage()` Bun fallback**: The local package installer now falls back to `bun install` when `npm install` fails and the runtime is Bun, instead of immediately returning `install_failed`.


## [0.2.8] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`ReadMediaFile` tool**: New capability-gated media input tool that sends image/video files as multimodal content blocks to the model. Availability is gated per-model by `imageIn`/`videoIn` capability flags — vision-free models never see the tool, preventing wasted tool_use blocks that the API would reject.
- **`imageIn`/`videoIn` capability fields**: Added to both `ModelCapabilities` and `ProviderCapabilities` interfaces (`providerRegistry.ts`) and populated for all 32 providers in `providers.json`. Each model entry now carries `imageIn: true/false` and `videoIn: false` (video support is opt-in; default off).
- **`video` content block type**: Added `{ type: 'video'; source; media_type }` to `ProviderContentBlock` union and wired through `contentBlockUtils.ts` (`fromAnthropicContentBlock` / `toAnthropicContentBlock`) so video blocks survive the Anthropic ↔ provider-agnostic conversion round-trip.
- **AnthropicAdapter video support**: `convertToOpenAI()` now handles `type: 'video'` content blocks (converted to `image_url` parts for OpenAI-compatible APIs). New `modelSupportsVideo()` method checks `videoIn` capability before sending.
- **AnthropicAdapter `imageIn` gating**: `modelSupportsVision()` now checks `imageIn` first (model-level, then provider-level), falling back to legacy `vision` flag for backward compatibility.

### Changed

- **ProviderManager exposed methods**: `getActiveProviderName()` and `getModelForProvider()` are now accessible from tool code, enabling tools like `ReadMediaFile` to check model capabilities at runtime.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **process_peer PTY terminal box UI**: When `mode: "pty"`, the tool progress now renders a bordered terminal-style Ink box showing provider, mode, cwd, elapsed time, and the command being run. PTY output is tailed with bounded recent-output buffer (16 lines) preserving ANSI SGR color while stripping unsupported terminal controls. Periodic progress updates keep elapsed time moving even when Codex produces no output.
- **`/peer run codex <task>` command**: New interactive command to run a one-shot Codex process peer directly from chat. Supports `-C, --cwd <dir>`, `-m, --model <model>`, and `-t, --timeout <seconds>` options.
- **Auto-update dialog**: Shows an update notification dialog before starting the Ink app when a newer npm version is available, with options to update or exit.
- **Model fetching from provider API**: API-fetched models now include `contextWindow`, `maxOutput`, `supportsTools`, `supportsVision`, `supportsReasoning`, and `free` fields parsed from API responses. Smart fallback between API data and static `providers.json` — API data takes priority, static fills gaps, with fuzzy model ID matching.
- **`/model list` capability tags**: Text output now shows per-model capability badges like `[200K ctx, vision, tools, reason, free]`.
- **`/model list` fetch timeout**: API model fetches now race against a 15-second timeout so a hung endpoint doesn't block the command.
- **Loading bar Unicode figures**: Added `█`, `▒`, `░`, `▔`, `▕` characters for custom progress rendering.
- **Message model display**: `MessageModel` component now shows provider label alongside model name (e.g. `OpenAI · gpt-5.5`) instead of the bare model string.
- **Cost in status line**: Total session cost is now shown in the status footer when spend is greater than $0.
- **GlimmerMessage gradient animation**: Rewritten shimmer animation with per-character color interpolation and fade-out effect at the tail end.
- **Added `displayCommand` field** to `ProcessPeerProgress` so the UI shows the logical command (e.g. `codex exec -C ...`) instead of the internal shell invocation.
- **Tool registry**: `ProcessPeerTool` registered in `getAllBaseTools()`.

### Changed

- **Model name rendering**: `renderModelName` now preserves `provider/model` format when the model contains a slash, instead of stripping the prefix.
- **Stats: sessionModel extraction**: Stats processing now prefers `message.sessionModel` for accurate provider and model extraction, improving aggregation accuracy across providers.
- **File edit message**: Updated file summary now shows compact `+N -M` format instead of verbose "Added N lines, Removed M lines" text.
- **PR merge strategy**: `gh pr merge` now uses `--squash` with the PR title as commit subject for cleaner history.
- **Mascot color UI**: Simplified color panel layout with section-cycle navigation and horizontal layout.
- **Anthropic API adapter**: OpenAI-compatible response path now correctly preserves the `provider` field and uses the more specific model name from the API response.

### Removed

- Removed unused `isCompact` variable.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-06-10

### Removed

- **GitHub Copilot provider**: Removed entire Copilot provider (CopilotProvider.ts, GitHubCopilotAuthFlow.tsx) and all copilot references from registry, provider list, onboarding, login, stats, model validation, and ComputerUseTool.
- **sharp from core dependencies**: Moved sharp to optionalDependencies so npm/bun install does not fail when native builds cannot compile. Added graceful fallback error in imageProcessor.ts.

### Added

- **User-visible Taste feedback**: Taste now shows notification toasts for init, learn, forget, suggest, auto-add, enable/disable actions. Added `onTasteFeedback` callback and `notifyTaste()` method. `recordEdit()` now triggers `processAutoLearn()`.
- **User-visible Peer feedback**: Added peerFeedback helper with REPL notification wiring. Peer tool calls now show progress and result notifications for discover, join, ping, run, send-message, list-roles, list-messages.
- **Peer HTTP liveness pings**: PeerStore now pings joined connections every 60s via `/peer-info`. Offline peers are marked immediately with `onPeerLost` callback instead of waiting 90s stale timeout.

### Changed

- **PeerSpawnTool**: Replaced `bun run start` with `clew` for spawning peer sessions.
- **`/agents` visual polish**: Redesigned AgentViewDashboard header with colored status dots, improved AgentViewRow column layout, cleaned up AgentViewGroupHeader with collapse arrows and counts, removed border clutter from AgentViewPeekPanel, and polished AgentsList dialog with cleaner agent grouping and typography.

### Fixed

- **`/providers` broken at runtime**: Fixed duplicate `const info` declaration in `provider-select.ts` that caused a runtime error preventing the provider picker from rendering.
- Fixed PR tool result mapping with `mapToolResultToToolResultBlockParam`.
- Fixed provider label ordering and fallback display in the model header.
- Fixed taste brief rendering so it appears as a proper chat system message instead of a task notification.
- Restored missing peer, loop, and MCP Thai documentation to git tracking.

- **AGENTS.md support**: loads alongside CLAUDE.md at all levels (Managed, User, Project, Additional dirs)
- **`.clew/` config directory**: primary instruction/config directory — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `rules/*.md` in `.clew/` load before `.claude/` variants (legacy fallback preserved)
  - User-level: `~/.clew/` via `getClewConfigHomeDir()` with `CLEW_CONFIG_DIR` env var support

- Taste brief uses proper SystemMessage instead of task-notification

### Changed

- Dev script: `bun run dev` builds with `--external` flags before running

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Box-in-Text render error**: Fixed `<Box> can't be nested inside <Text>` crash in `AssistantToolUseMessage` when a tool's `renderToolUseMessage` returns a `<Box>` layout component (e.g. `PRTool`). The result is now handled based on type - strings are safely wrapped in `<Text>`, while React elements are rendered as siblings to avoid Ink's nesting constraint.

### Added

- **Peer system** (`/peer`): LAN + same-machine worker discovery and task assignment
  - `/peer share` - advertise as a worker (writes to temp dir + UDP multicast)
  - `/peer discover` - scan for workers (reads temp dir + LAN), shows hostname, IP, port, shell, cwd
  - `/peer list` - interactive worker table with keyboard navigation
  - `/peer todo <worker> <task>` - assign tasks to workers
  - `/peer todos` - view received tasks, `/peer todo done <id>` - mark complete
  - **File-based registry** for same-machine (OS temp dir) + **UDP multicast** for LAN
  - Each instance gets a unique peer ID (includes PID for multi-shell support)
  - Per-instance color from peer ID hash
  - New files: `src/peer/` (types, discovery, server, store) + `src/commands/peer/`

- **AI peer tools**: 6 new tools for autonomous worker coordination
  - `peer_discover` - AI scans for workers on LAN/same-machine
  - `peer_send_task` - AI assigns tasks to workers via HTTP POST
  - `peer_list_tasks` - AI checks pending/completed tasks
  - `peer_share` - AI can start/stop/check advertising
  - `peer_info` - AI gets detailed info about a specific peer
  - `peer_run` - AI runs shell commands on remote workers (with exec endpoint)
  - `peer_set_name` - AI assigns a custom display name to a worker
  - `peer_set_role` - AI assigns a role (builder, tester, deployer, etc.) to a worker
  - `peer_list_roles` - AI lists all workers with their names and roles
  - `/peer inbox` - View pending messages from peers; selecting one injects it into the AI prompt with `submitNextInput: true`

- **Effort support for all providers**: `/effort` now works with any provider that has `reasoningEffort: true` in its capabilities (NVIDIA, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, etc.)
  - `modelSupportsEffort()` checks provider registry for `reasoningEffort` capability in addition to Claude model name matching
  - `AnthropicAdapter.convertToOpenAI()` maps Anthropic `output_config.effort` → OpenAI `reasoning_effort` parameter, so effort settings are actually sent to the API

- **NVIDIA model fetching from API**: `/model` now fetches live models from NVIDIA's `/v1/models` endpoint instead of relying solely on `providers.json`
  - Added `nvidia` to `supportsModelFetching()` in `fetchProviderModels.ts`
  - When API-fetched models are available, they replace the static `providers.json` list entirely (API is source of truth)

- **Model picker capability display**: Shows context window, vision, tools, reasoning, and free tags per model

- **Taste auto-learn system**: New `src/services/taste/auto-learn/` module
  - `PatternDetector` - detects repeating coding patterns from accept/reject/edit events
  - `AutoLearnEngine` - manages suggestions with confidence tracking and cooldown
  - Auto-detection runs automatically on every signal (accept/reject), no manual trigger needed
  - `/taste suggest` - view detected patterns, `/taste suggest accept <id>` - add as rule, `/taste suggest reject <id>` - dismiss

- **AI-driven codebase analysis**: `/taste init` now analyzes git log, config files, and source samples via the current AI provider to generate 3-10 initial taste rules with confidence scores

- **Taste init progress bar**: ASCII progress bar animation during initialization (`████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ 40%`)

- **Relay server** (`src/remote/relay-server.ts`): WebSocket relay for cross-network remote control
  - `/remote listen --relay <url>` - host connects through relay
  - `/remote connect <url> --token <token> --relay` - connector connects
  - `/remote exec <command>` - execute commands on remote host

- **Dynamic workflow live subagent status**: Footer now shows running subagents in real-time
  - `◈ ultracode [2/5] ⟐coder ⟐researcher` - live per-subtask status
  - Runner saves "running" state to disk so the progress UI can poll it

- **Voice input via browser Web Speech API**: `/voice` now captures speech through Google Chrome's built-in speech recognition - no API keys needed. Clean card UI with waveform visualization, Record/Stop/Send buttons, 20+ languages. Auto-submits transcript via `/voice check`. See `src/services/voiceInput/`
- **Buddy card UI**: `/buddy` shows a full card with ASCII sprite, rarity badges, stat bars, and personality. `/buddy name <name>` renames companion.
- **Context grid layout**: `/context` redesigned with 10×10 usage grid (⛁/⬚), model info, categories, and detail sections
- **Usage history & preview data**: `ContextData` includes `usageHistory` array for sparkline and `preview` field on system prompt sections

### Fixed

- **Model picker scroll bugs**:
  - `onUpFromFirstItem` now correctly detects the first non-disabled option instead of `options[0]`, which could be a section header (e.g. "Recent") that can never receive focus
  - Focus position is preserved when options change (e.g. API-fetched models arrive mid-scroll) instead of resetting to the default
  - Removed redundant `onUpFromFirstItem` from ModelPicker (search is already active by default)

- **NVIDIA model validation**: Added `nvidia` to `nonAnthropicProviders` list in `validateModel.ts` to skip API validation for NVIDIA models

- **NVIDIA model IDs**: Fixed model IDs in `providers.json` to match NVIDIA NIM API format (`glm-5.1` → `z-ai/glm-5.1`, `nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` → `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`)

- **SPARKLINE_WIDTH missing**: Added missing constant in `ContextStats.tsx`

### Changed

- **Terminal title**: `process.title` changed from `claude` to `clew` in `src/main.tsx`
- **Taste status line removed**: `ⓘ taste: N rules` no longer shown in footer
- **Buddy rendering**: `CompanionSprite` no longer gated by compile-time flag - checks companion config directly; `/buddy hide` now respects `companion.visible` field
- **Ultra mode decoration**: When ultracode is active (via `/effort ultracode`), prompt input shows a purple double-line border with "ultra" label
- **PR badge refresh**: `usePrStatus` hook fetches immediately after a turn ends, so badge updates right after `gh` commands

### Changed

- **Model picker API-fetched capability display**: API-fetched models now show the same rich capability badges (`vision · tools · reasoning · free`) as static models
  - Extended `FetchedModel` interface with `supportsTools`, `supportsVision`, `supportsReasoning`, `maxOutput`, `free` fields
  - After fetching from API, capability data is merged from static `providers.json` by matching model IDs
  - `/model list` text output now shows capability tags like `[200K ctx, vision, tools, reason]`
  - Models not in `providers.json` still work - fall back to showing context window only

- **CLI hints rebranded from `claude` to `clew`**: All user-facing CLI command hints in exit messages, session manager, bridge, teleport, auth, MCP, plugins, and SSH output now reference `clew` instead of `claude`
  - Exit/resume messages now show `clew --teleport`, `clew remote-control --continue`
  - Session manager commands: `clew agents`, `clew attach`, `clew stop`, etc.
  - `clew auth login`, `clew mcp add`, `clew plugin install`, `clew ssh`
  - `clew --bg` for background sessions

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **Stats provider aggregation**: `/stats` now correctly aggregates usage across multiple providers
  - Added `normalizeProviderId()` to map aliases (Bedrock→Anthropic, Vertex→Google, Grok→XAI, etc.) to canonical registry keys
  - Provider extraction now prioritizes model name format (`provider/model`) over unreliable message metadata
  - All merge paths (live + cache, cache-to-cache, filtered ranges) normalize provider IDs for consistent aggregation
  - Added provider breakdown in Overview tab showing tokens, percentage, and cost per provider
  - Models tab now correctly groups models by normalized provider ID

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Taste interactive menu** (`/taste`): Arrow-key navigable Dialog with 11 actions (learn, forget, profile, events, decay, eval, export, import, on, off, status). Spinner/loading state for async operations (decay, eval). Inline success messages. Pre-fills input for learn/forget/export via `nextInput`.
- **Edit validation via taste**: `validateEdit()` called in `FileEditPermissionRequest.tsx` - shows `⚠ Taste flagged this edit` warning in dialog title/question when edit violates learned rules.
- **Settings change subscription**: `subscribeToSettingsChanges()` called during `initTasteOnStartup()` - live-reloads taste config when `settings.json` changes.
- **TasteStatusLine component** (`src/components/TasteStatusLine.tsx`): Shows `ⓘ taste: N rules` in `PromptInputFooter.tsx` alongside `DynamicWorkflowStatusLine`.
- **MessageDisplay hook infrastructure**: Added `onMessageDisplay` prop to Messages component with transform tracking ref and useEffect. Wired in REPL.tsx via `executeMessageDisplayHooks` with `ToolUseContext`. Enables future session hooks to hide or modify displayed messages.

### Changed

- **Model picker grouped by all providers**: `/model` now iterates `PROVIDER_IDS` and shows models from every provider in separate named sections, instead of only the active provider's models. Recent models still appear at top with defaults.
- **XML tag rename**: `<clew_taste1>` → `<clew_taste>`, `<clew_taste1_constraints>` → `<clew_taste_constraints>` in `TastePromptInjector.ts`, `TasteRegressionSuite.ts`, and tests.
- **Provider auto-persist**: Last-used provider and model are saved to `provider.json` even without `--global` flag.
- **Commander program name**: `.name('claude')` → `.name('clew')` in `src/main.tsx:1394`.
- **Documentation**: All docs HTML, CHANGELOG, README (en/zh/th) updated with taste system, version bump.

### Fixed

- **Autocomplete hint duplication**: `PromptInput.tsx` clears `argumentHint` when `inlineGhostText` is present, preventing duplicate hint display.
- **Blank screen on startup**: Fixed SentryErrorBoundary + TDZ race in `REPL.tsx`.
- **ProviderManager base URL**: Session-level `/providers` overrides now correctly resolve base URLs.
- **PowerShell prefix/wildcard rules for native executables (Security 2.2)**: Rules like `PowerShell(dotnet.exe build:*)` now correctly pre-approve native executables. Added `ruleContentNamesElement()` check at the `nameType` gate in `powershellPermissions.ts:1339`.
- **Malformed PowerShell tool calls misclassification (Security 2.4)**: Added `!input?.command` guard in `PowerShellTool.isReadOnly()`.
- **Bash runtime output byte limit (Security 2.5)**: Added 100MB max output threshold in `BashTool.tsx exec()`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Guardian auto-review mode** (`/guardian`): LLM-based permission request reviewer using Haiku-class model. Routes boundary-crossing actions to a separate reviewer agent instead of pausing for user. Includes circuit breaker (3 consecutive denials → interrupt turn), rolling-window tracking (10/50), and custom policy support.
- **`/approve` command**: Override Guardian denials for one-time retry. Lists recent denials (up to 10) and allows selective override by ID.
- **`/pr` command**: Full GitHub PR lifecycle - create, list, view, review (AI diff analysis), merge, and CI status check.
- **Bridge v2 - Provider-agnostic Remote Control** (`/remote`): Direct WebSocket-based remote control without claude.ai OAuth. Includes RemoteServer (HTTP API + WebSocket), SHA-256 hashed one-time token store, RelayClient for NAT traversal, and REPL session bridging via `useRemoteBridge` hook.
- **Dynamic Workflow Bootstrap**: Wired ultracode globals into AppStateProvider and entrypoints. Interactive Y/n confirm hook for first-run cost warning.
- **Dynamic Workflow Progress UI**: Live progress component in PromptInputFooter showing subtask completion and verification status. Polls `.claude/runs/` every 3s.
- **Transcript classifier suggestion**: Context-aware suggestion - `/effort ultracode` for complex tasks, `/ultracode on` for moderate ones.

### Changed

- Bumped version to 0.2.0.
- AgentRunner uses role-specific system prompts (researcher cites files, verifier adversarial).
- Confirm hook now properly prompts user (Y/n) with 30s timeout.
